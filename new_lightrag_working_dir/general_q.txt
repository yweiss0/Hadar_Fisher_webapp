hybrid:
### Overview of the Experiment

The study involves a group of 98 adolescents participating in an experiment aimed at analyzing emotional fluctuations, particularly negative emotions such as sadness, anger, and nervousness. 

### Methodology

Participants provide data through Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) surveys, allowing for real-time assessment of their emotional states. The data collected is evaluated using various statistical models, including Random Forest and Elastic Net, to predict and analyze negative affect.

### Analysis Approaches

The research employs both Nomothetic and Idiographic approaches: 
- **Nomothetic models** analyze group-level trends from aggregated data.
- **Idiographic models** focus on individual-level variations, capturing personal emotional responses.

The effectiveness of these models is assessed through performance metrics, such as RÂ² values and RMSE. The study ultimately aims to enhance understanding of emotional dynamics among adolescents and improve predictive modeling of emotional states.
