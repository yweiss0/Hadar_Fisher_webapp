Unlike predefined dictionaries, LDA generates topics directly from the \ndata, identifying latent patterns in word usage. Each word is assigned to one or more topics, \niterating until an optimal balance is reached. This results in a set of posterior probability \ndistributions, which approximates the likelihood of each word occurring within each topic. This \nallows LDA to create semantically coherent clusters, overcoming word sense ambiguities by \ncontextually assigning words to topics. We ran LDA on one - to thr ee-word phrases, rather than \n 9 individual words alone, so that phrases such as  ‘Summer camp ’ are treated as a single term . We \nimplemented Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) using distinct approaches for nomothetic and \nidiographic analyses. For the nomothetic model, we extracted a uniform set of topics across the \nentire sample. For the idiographic model, we derived personalized topics unique to each \nindividual.  \nThe latent topics were extracted from the preprocessed text corpus using probabilistic \nmodeling with the R package topicmodels (Grün & Hornik, 2011) . For the whole -sample \n(nomothetic) LDA, before creating the model, we performed the tuning of the algorithm to \ndefine the number k of topics using ldatuning . To determine the optimal number of topics, we \nevaluated the quality of topic modeling using three metrics: Griffiths2004 (Griffiths2004), \nCaoJuan2009  (Cao et al., 2009) , and Arun2010 (Arun et al., 2010) . These metrics included both \nminimization criteria (CaoJuan2009 and Arun2010), which are optimized when minimized, and \nmaximization criteria (Griffiths2004), which are optimized when maximized. Additionally, \nDeveaud2014  provided a reference point that decreases linearly with the number of topics.  We \nselected six topics based on model fit metrics, as illustrated in Figure 1. The selection of six \ntopics reflected a balance among these metrics. Table 1 represents  each topic by its 15 most \nhighly frequent  words, providing a clear semantic foundation for further analysis.  \nLarge Language Models (GPT).  To generate emotion ratings using large language \nmodels (LLMs), we employed the Generative Pre -trained Transformer (GPT), an autoregressive \nAI language model developed by OpenAI. GPT is built on a transformer -based architecture, a \nneural network design tha t excels at processing sequential data by using self -attention \nmechanisms to capture contextual relationships across words. This allows GPT to generate \nhuman -like text by predicting the next word in a sequence based on the prov ided context.  \n 10 Specifically, we utilized GPT -4, an advanced version pre -trained on a vast dataset \n(45TB), enabling it to generate coherent sentences and perform various tasks such as writing, \nanswering questions, and engaging in conversations. In this study, we prompted GPT-4 to rate \nthe extent to which a participant experienced one of the following emotions: Sadness, Anger, and \nNervousness, on a scale of 1 to 5 (similar to the scale used in EMA), based on responses to three \nopen -text questions. See the online supplement for the full prompt used to generate GPT \nresponses.  \nData Analysis  \nModel Specification  \nWe compared both nomothetic (group -level) and idiographic (individual -level) models in \ntheir ability to predict variability in negative emotional states within  individuals over time.  We \nemployed two machine learning approaches to predict negative affect: elastic net regression and \nrandom forest models. Elastic net regularization (ENR) is a popular regression technique that \ncombines two types of penalties: ridge and lasso. This combina tion helps address issues related \nto multicollinearity by constraining the coefficients of correlated variables while also minimizing \nmodel overfitting. On the other hand, random forest (RF) is an ensemble learning method based \non decision trees. Unlike EN R, random forest can capture complex nonlinear relationships and \ninteractions between variables without having to specify them in advance. Given that these two \nmethods use different strategies for selecting and weighting variables, comparing them can help \nto determine which one provides the most accurate predictions in a given context.  \nTo assess model performance and generalizability while minimizing overfitting, we \nimplemented a nested cross -validation (CV) procedure using the nestedcv  package (Lewis et al., \n2023). This method consists of two levels of cross -validation:  1. Outer loop: Evaluates the \n 11 overall performance of the model by repeatedly training and testing on different subsets of the \ndata.  2. Inner loop: Conducts model selection and hyperparameter tuning to optimize \nperformance.  We used 10 -fold cross -validation in both the inner and outer loops. In the outer \nloop, the dataset was divided into ten folds . The model was trained on nine folds and tested on \nthe remaining fold, with this process repeated ten times so that each fold served as the test set \nonce. This iterative process ensures that pe rformance metrics are evaluated across multiple train -\ntest splits, providing a robust estimate of generalizability.  Within the inner loop, models were \ntrained on each training fold, and hyperparameter tuning was conducted by selecting the \nparameter combination that maximized\n######################\nOutput:\n"

Exclusion criteria included history or current diagnosis of any of the \nfollowing DSM -5 psychiatric illnesses: major depressive disorder, schizophrenia spectrum or \nother psychotic disorder, bipolar disorder, substance or alcohol use disorder within the past 12 \nmonths or lifetime sever e substance or alcohol use disorder , as well as current diagnosis of \nanorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa  for an additional information about sample inclusion and \nexclusion criteria see Murray et al., (2023) . \nProcedure    \nAll procedures were approved by the Mass General Brigham IRB. Written informed \nconsent was provided by participants who were 18 years of age, as well as from parents of \nparticipants who were under 18 years of age, along with the participant’s written informed \nassent. At the baseline session participants were administered a semi -structured clinical \ninterview , the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (K -SADS; Kaufman \net al., 1997) , either in -person or over Zoom . Participants also  completed self -report measures  and \ninstalled the MetricWire App on their smartphones to complete ecological mom entary \nassessments (EMAs). EMA surveys were delivered 3-4 times per day whereby participants were \n 7 randomly signaled during two timeslots ( 4 pm  to 6:30 pm  and 6:30 pm  to 9 pm ) during a 5 -day \nperiod (Thursday - Monday). A third survey was sent on weekends ( 11 am -4 pm ). Of the \nparticipants, 39 completed the EMA for four consecutive weeks, while 59 completed it over four \nweeks on an every -other -week schedule.  \nEcological Momentary Assessment (EMA): Participants were asked to rate on a 5 -point \nLikert scale, ranging from 1, “Very slightly or not at all,” to 5, “Extremely”  the extent to which \nthey were feeling several emotions immediately before they started the assessment . Participants’ \nnegative affect (NA) included responses for: “sad,” “nervous,” and “angry.” Mean NA was \nmeasured by averaging the three NA variables.  In addition, participants responded to the \nfollowing open -ended questions: 1) What were you thinking about right before you started this \nsurvey?  2) Think about the most enjoyable or happy time  since you completed the last survey  (or \nif this is your first survey, then the last 24 hours). Very briefly, what happened (1 -2 sentences is \nfine)?  3) Think about the most stressful or negative time since you completed the last survey  (or \nif this is your first survey, then the last 24 hours).

Participants with fewer than 30 observations were excluded from the analysis.  \nLanguage Measures  \nWe used the following strategies to extract text features and generate quantitative \nsummaries of the language data.  \nClose vocabulary : For close vocabulary, we extracted features using the Linguistic \nInquiry and Word Count (LIWC ; Tausczik & Pennebaker, 2010)  and the Valence Aware \nDictionary and sEntiment Reasoner (VADER ; Hutto & Gilbert, 2014) . LIWC is a computerized \ntext analysis tool that categorizes words into over 90 linguistic and psychological dimensions \nbased on an internal dictionary of approximately 6,400 words  (Boyd & Schwartz, 2021) . It \n 8 calculates the percentage of words that match each predefined category, offering insights into \nlinguistic structures (e.g., pronouns), psychological constructs (e.g., affect), and broader \nlanguage patterns (e.g., analytical thinking).  The LIWC has been extensively validated across \nnumerous studies and is widely used in psychological research to quantify language use patterns \nassociated with various psychological states and traits. For this study, we used LIWC -22 (Boyd \net al., 2022) , the latest version of the software, the analyze participants'  responses to the EMA \nopen questions.  \nVADER  is a simple rule -based model for general sentiment analysis  optimized for social \nmedia . It provides four sentiment scores: negative, positive, neutral, and compound (an overall \nsentiment score from -1 to +1). VADER is particularly effective at handling sentiments \nexpressed in short, informal text and accounts for factors like punctuation, capita lization, and \nmodifiers (e.g., intensifiers like \"very\") that influence the intensity of the sentiment.  Whereas \nLIWC excels in offering detailed psychological and linguistic insights across a wide range of \ntexts, VADER is more attuned to detecting sentiment polarity and intensity in social media. \nFinally , text lengths were extracted as features for each question and included in the models.  \nOpen vocabulary : Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a probabilistic clustering method \nthat groups words into topics based on their co -occurrence across a text corpus  (Blei et al., 2003; \nGriffiths et al., 2007) . Unlike predefined dictionaries, LDA generates topics directly from the \ndata, identifying latent patterns in word usage. Each word is assigned to one or more topics, \niterating until an\n######################\nOutput:\n"

The model was trained on nine folds and tested on \nthe remaining fold, with this process repeated ten times so that each fold served as the test set \nonce. This iterative process ensures that pe rformance metrics are evaluated across multiple train -\ntest splits, providing a robust estimate of generalizability.  Within the inner loop, models were \ntrained on each training fold, and hyperparameter tuning was conducted by selecting the \nparameter combination that maximized performance on a validation set. The best -performing \nmodel was then applied to the corresponding  outer loop test set. By separating hyperparameter \noptimization from performance evaluation, this approach prevents data leakage and mitigat es the \nrisk of overfitting.  Nested cross -validation offers several advantages over a simple train -test split. \nIt allows for efficient use of all available data for both training and validation while reducing the \nbias introduced by a single, potentially unrepresentative data split. Ad ditionally, by incorporating \nmultiple train -test iterations, this approach yields a more robust and reliable estimate of model \nperformance, ensuring that the findings generalize beyond the specific dataset used in training.  \nAfter iterating through all outer folds, we aggregated the predictions from the left -out test \nsets and compared them against true values to compute overall predictive performance. We \nassessed model accuracy using R²  and root mean squared error (RMSE).  We consider RMSE to \nbe an intuitive metric for assessing predictive accuracy on a target variable measured on a 7 -\npoint Likert scale, as it accounts for larger errors more heavily and allows us to make statements \nsuch as, “on average, the model’s predictio n deviates from momentary subjective stress by \napproximately 0.80 points on a 7 -point scale.”  \n 12  \nFirst, we ran nomothetic models that included features extracted from all three NLP \napproaches, including all subjects  for group -level analysis. These models aimed to identify \ncommon predictors of negative emotional states at the group level.  To assess how well group -\nlevel models performed for individual participants , we adopted a nomothetic -idiographic \napproach, where metrics derived from nomothetic models  such as R2 were calculated separately \nfor each participant.  \nFinally, we employed fully idiographic models, building separate models for each \nparticipant to capture person -specific language -emotion associations . These models focus \nexclusively on within -person variability, enabling highly individualized predictions. By \ncomparing the three  abovementioned  approaches, we aimed to understand their relative strengths \nin predicting negative affect.  In these  idiographic models, variables with low variance were \nremoved based on standard frequency criteria, where the most comm on value  for that variable  \ncould not exceed 95% of the total observations.  \n \nFeature importance  \nTo evaluate feature importance, we used SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values, \nwhich quantify the contribution of each feature to the model's predictions in a consistent and \ninterpretable manner by assessing how variations in a feature impact the model's output  \n(Lundberg, 2017) . SHAP values were calculated using the R package s fastshap  and ggbeeswarm , \nwhich facilitates visualization and interpretation of feature contributions. This method allowed us \nto identify the relative importance of predictors in the model and their specific effects on the \npredicted outcomes.  \n 13 Results  \nDemographic and clinical characteristics  \nTable 2 presents the demographic and clinical characteristics of the participants. \nParticipants  completed an average of XX EMA surveys (s.d. =  XX). Average EMA compliance \nwas XX% (s.d. =  XX%).  \nModel performance  \nModel performance metrics for the nomothetic (one model combinging all  observations \nfrom all participants), nomothetic -idiographic ( same as above  but calculating performance \nseparately for each participant), and idiographic (building separate  model s for each individual) \napproaches using text features extrac ted from the three NLP approaches to predict negative \naffect are shown in Table 3.  \nThe nomothetic model s generally outperformed both the nomothetic -idiographic and \nidiographic models across all emotions. Specifically, when predicting negative affect, sadness, \nanger, and nervousness, the nomothetic RF model yielded R² values of 0.38, 0.33, 0.20 and 0.24, \nrespectively, whereas the nomothetic ENR model yielded R² values of 0. 17, 0.14, 0.13 and 0. 11, \nrespectively . The substantially higher performance of the random forest model can be attributed \nto its ability to account for participant ID  (grouping by individuals) , which Elastic net cannot. \nThis inference is supported by the feature importance analysis shown in Figure 2, where \nparticipant ID emerges as the most important feature in the RF model. This finding points to \nsubstantial differences between individuals in their average levels of nega tive affect , \nemphasizing the importance of person -specific modeling approaches to better capture within -\nperson fluctuations.   \n 14 Building on this and aligning with the ultimate translational goal of using text to track \nwithin -person fluctuations in negative emotions (rather than between -person differences), we \nproceed to evaluate the model's predictive performance for each participant individually \n(nomothetic -idiographic approach). Performance decreased substantially,  with mean R² values in \nthe range of 0.06 -0.11.  However, there was considerable variability in predictive accuracy across \nparticipants. For example, when predicting negative affect , R² values ranged from 0.00 to 0.41.\n######################\nOutput:\n"

Performance decreased substantially,  with mean R² values in \nthe range of 0.06 -0.11.  However, there was considerable variability in predictive accuracy across \nparticipants. For example, when predicting negative affect , R² values ranged from 0.00 to 0.41. \nFor anger , R² achieved values as high as 0. 69, indicating that for some participants, text features \nexplained little or no variability in negative affect, while for others, text features explained a \nsignificant portion of the variability.  \nThe idiographic approach (individual models) showed similar average performance to the \nnomothetic –idiographic approach, with mean R² values ranging from 0.06 to 0.10. Figure 3 \ndemonstrates examples of high vs. low accuracy person specific models. Figure 4 further shows \nthat, despite this individual variation, the overall trend (represented by the dashed line) \ndemonstrates a generally positive relationship between predic ted and actual negative affect \nratings.  The comparison between the nomothetic –idiographic  and idiographic approaches yielded \nmixed results. Differences emerged in their ability to achieve relatively high performance for \nspecific individuals and in the proportion of significant associations across all participants . For \nnegative affect, the idiographic approach exhibited a wider range of R² values across \nparticipants, implying that this model achieved higher performance for some participants . \nHowever,  the nomothetic –idiographic approach slightly outperformed it in terms of the \nproportion of parti cipants with significant associations (55 –58% vs. 43 –48%). A similar pattern \nwas observed for sadness, suggesting that although person‐specific models can yield higher \n 15 accuracy for certain participants, the nomothetic –idiographic approach  is more robust for \nidentifying significant associations across a larger number of individuals.  \nFor anger, the nomothetic –idiographic approach not only showed greater variability in R² \nvalues but also identified more significant associations than the idiographic approach. In \ncontrast, for nervousness, the fully idiographic approach demonstrated both greater variability —\nallowing some participants to achieve R² values as high as 0.71 —and a larger  number of \nsignificant associations overall.  \nWhich Text Features Are Most Predictive in High - vs. Low -Performing Models?  \nFigure 5 displays the top 10 text features from the four best -performing subject -specific \nrandom forest models predicting negative affect. Critically, t his visualization demonstrates \nsignificant variation in the features influencing each participant's model, suggesting differences \nin the relative importance of features derived from various NLP approaches (LIWC, VADER, \nLDA, and GPT) across individuals. Though  feature importance varied across individuals, we \nalso examined whether specific patterns emerged across high - and low -performing participant -\nspecific models and whether certain NLP approaches provided more influential features in high -\nperforming models  compared to low -performing ones.  \nParticipants were divided into groups based on model performance  (R2), with the top 25% \n(n=25) classified as \"High R2\"  and the bottom 25% (n=25) as \"Low R2.\" Feature importance \nscores were analyzed separately for RF and ENR models. Importantly, p articipants with high - \nand low -performing models showed no significant difference in number of observation s (RF: \nHigh mean =72.84 , Low mean=60.64 , t=1. 69, p=0.0 9, CI=-2.31;26.71 , ENR:  High mean =62.72, \nLow mean=71.36, t=-1.26, p=0. 21, CI=-22.38;5.10) or in mean negative affect (RF: High mean \n=0.68, Low mean=0.45, t=1.85, p=0.07, CI= -0.02;0.49, ENR:  High mean =0.77, Low mean=0.65, \n 16 t=0.72, p=0. 47, CI= -0.20;0.43) but for RF high and low performing models  differed significantly \nin variability (RF: High mean =0.61, Low mean=0.40, t=3.26, p=0.002, CI=0.08;0.33, but not for \nENR:  High mean =0.59, Low mean=0.50, t=1.29, p=0. 20, CI= -0.05;0.22). Assessment number \n(\"Time\") emerged as the most important feature in both RF and ENR models, suggesting that \ntime-related variability was a relatively strong predictor of NA among  the “High R2” subjects . In \naddition, as shown in Figure 6, for the RF high -performing models (High R² group), the top 5 \nimportant variables included features from different approaches (LIWC, GPT, VADER, and \nLDA). Notably, 3 of the top 5 variables that differed the most between the High R² and Low R² \ngroups were GPT features  (e.g.. ….) , suggesting that GPT -derived variables may have been \nparticularly effective at enhancing model performance. In contrast, for high -performing ENR \nmodels, the most important predictive features were from LIWC  (e.g., xxxx) ,\n######################\nOutput:\n"

For example,  Aalbers et al., 2023  used \nsmartphone passive sensor data to predict stress levels. Their findings revealed that idiographic \nmodels demonstrated higher accuracy in tracking stress levels for some participants (Spearman’s \nρ rank -order correlation up to 1 in idiographic models vs. up to .65 in nomothetic models ). \nHowever, nomothetic models significantly predicted stress for a larger proportion of participants \n(up to 23.2% for idiographic models vs. up to 55% for nomothetic models ). Rozet et al. (2019) \nused a comparable method and initi ally found that nomothetic models performed better (i.e., \nwere more accurate) than idiographic models. However, as more data accumulated, the \nperformance of the idiographic model eventually equaled and then surpassed that of the \nnomothetic model, suggestin g that idiographic models may be a better option when sufficient \ndata is available .   \nWhen comparing specific NLP approaches, GPT outperformed other models in its ability \nto monitor fluctuations in emotional states. It achieved R² values comparable to a combined \nmodel and demonstrated significant associations with reported emotions for 57% of the \nparticipants. However, it is important to note that despite these strong R² values, GPT also \nproduced higher RMSE scores compared to the combined models. This discrepancy implies that \nwhile GPT effectively captures the overall variance in emotional states, it may be less precise in \npredicting the exact numerical values of these states. Such findings highlight the trade -off \nbetween capturing broad patterns and maintaining fine -grained precision —a balance that future \nresearch should aim to optimize , with fine -tuning offering one promising avenue for \nenhancement.  \n 20 These  findings are consistent with recent work by Rathje et al., (2024) , which reported \nhigh correlations (r = 0.66 to 0.75) between GPT -4 outputs and human ratings of emotion , \nwhereas  dictionary -based approaches showed much lower correlations (r = 0.22 to 0.30). The \nhigher correlation between GPT and human ratings in Rathje et al. (2024) study is expected as \nboth GPT and human raters evaluated the emotion directly expressed in text, whereas our study \naimed to predict participants’ self -reported emotional experiences —a task complicated by the \nfact that individuals do not always  explicitly communicate their internal states. Thus, while GPT \nand human annotation in Rathje et al. represent agreement between two raters performing the \nsame task, our approach required GPT to infer emotions that participants may not have explicitly \nexpressed.   \nFrom an applied perspective, GPT's efficiency and minimal training data requirements \nmake it particularly attractive for studies with limited datasets. However, the model's lack of \ntransparency and inability to explicitly articulate the rationale behind it s predictions remain \ncritical limitations that researchers must carefully weigh  (Feuerriegel et al., 2025) . Given these \nconsiderations, we recommend that researchers thoughtfully evaluate GPT's role in their \nanalytical pipeline, considering whether to employ it as a standalone tool or integrate it with \ncomplementary approaches. Future work should focus on deve loping methods that combine \nGPT's powerful inference capabilities with more transparent analytical approaches, potentially \noffering a more robust framework for emotion analysis in psychological research.  \nThis study is the first to use different NLP approaches to directly compare nomothetic and \nidiographic models for tracking emotional fluctuations.  Yet, f indings of this study should be \ninterpreted in light of several limitations . First, capturing the nuanced dynamics of emotional \nexpression typically requires large amounts of data. In everyday interactions, subtle emotional \n 21 changes may only become apparent with extensive exposure to an individual’s language use —\nmuch like knowing someone well enables you to discern small shifts in their mood. Therefore, \nfuture studies should strive to collect larger datasets, potentially sourc ed from daily -life \ncommunications, to enhance the ability to track and model these nuances.  \nSecond, the overall predictive accuracy was modest , leaving significant room for \nimprovement. In addition  to increasing the quantity of data, future research could benefit from \nincorporating additional modalities (e.g., vocal features, facial expression, passive sensors ) \nalongside text. Prior studies have shown that combining various modalities can enhance the \nperformance of nomothetic models of emotion  (see Gandhi et al., 2023  for a review ), this \nmultimodal approach may also improve idiographic  models. Moreover, future work should \nexplore whether individuals not only differ in the text features that predict their emotions but \nalso in the types of modalities that best capture their emotional states.  Relatedly, our analysis of \ntext features importance across high - and low -performing person -specific models did not reveal a \nsingle pattern differentiating the groups.

These methods are better at capturing nuances, addressing \nambiguous word meanings, and are less susceptible to misinterpretations. Limitations of open -\nvocabulary approaches include the need for more technical expertise, larger datasets, and careful \nconsi deration of parameter choices, as well as challenges in interpretability  (Eichstaedt et al., \n2021; van Loon, 2022) . More recently, LLMs like GPT have shown great promise in accurately \nidentifying various psychological constructs in text, overcoming many of the constraints of older \nmethods (Rathje et al., 2024). These models can interpret the context of words and have achieved \neffective results across multiple languages with simple prompts. The m ain limitations of this \napproach include a lack of transparency in how inferences were generated and difficulties in \nreproducing results due to their probabilistic nature (Abdurahman et al., 2024) . For example, \nalthough LLM -based approaches could predict whether  a person experience s negative emotion s \nbased on  social media posts, LLMs could not  be used to identify which linguistic cues (such as \nthe use of pronouns)  predict this experience  (Feuerriegel et al., 2025; Rathje et al., 2024) . In the \nlatter case, dictionary -based methods  are preferrable. Ultimately, closed - and open -vocabulary \napproaches, along with advancements in LLMs, provide complementary strengths that \n 4 significantly enhance our ability to understand psychological states through language. By \ncombining these methods, researchers can leverage their unique advantages while mitigating \ntheir limitations, offering a robust alternative to traditional  and relatively cumbersome  self-report \nmeasures  assessing emotions . \nDespite the increasing sophistication of these methods, significant gaps remain in the \ncurrent literature. Most importantly, existing studies on text -based emotion prediction have \nfocused on exploring between -person differences, primarily identifying which  text features are \nassociated with individuals experiencing high levels of negative emotions  (e.g., Tackman et al., \n2019) . These approaches aggregate data across participants and aim to pinpoint common \nlinguistic markers, such as the use of first -person pronouns or negative sentiment, that are \nindicative of heightened emotional distress and depression  (Bathina et al., 2021; Funkhouser et \nal., 2024) . However, this method overlooks both between -person differences in how linguistic \nmarkers relate to emotions and within -person fluctuations in emotional states . Even when using \nmultilevel models to predict within -person fluctuations  in emotions , models assumes that the \nsame linguistic features signal high levels of negative emotions across different individuals \n(Funkhouser et al., 2024) . Such assumptions fail to account for the fact that language is \ninherently idiosyncratic, with individuals expressing emotions in unique and context -dependent \nways. Beck & Jackson, (2022)  demonstrated the importance of idiographic approaches by \nshowing that the psychological and situational antecedents that predicted future loneliness varied \nsubstantially across participants, with no two individuals showing the same pattern of predictive \nfeatures. This highlights the need for personalized models that adapt to the distinctive ways \npeople express emotions through text, enabling more accurate predictions tailored to each \nindividual .  \n 5 Moreover, previous research has typically studied language features in isolation, missing \nthe potential benefits of combining different language -based methods (Carlier et al., 2022) . This \nis especially important as features that may be significant for one individual may be not \nimportant for others. To address these limitations, t his study integrat es diverse language -based \ntools and leverag es machine learning to develop personalized  models capable of monitoring \nwithin -person fluctuations in emotional states.  \nThe Present Study  \nThe study's primary goal is to evaluate the effectiveness of various text analysis and \nmachine learning techniques in tracking within -person fluctuations in negative affect (NA) over \ntime.  Since  individuals express emotions in a variety of linguistic ways, this research aims to \ndevelop more personalized approaches to emotion tracking.  \nIn addition to this main objective , we address two key questions:  \n1) Do idiographic  (individ ual-level ) models outperform nomothetic  (group -level)  models \nin predicting fluctuations?  This question is motivated by  the fact that  individuals  may \nexpress emotions through language in highly unique ways.  \n2) Is combining various NLP approaches beneficial for emotion prediction?  \nThe research employs and compares three types of Natural Language Processing (NLP) \napproaches , which, as noted above, have complementary strengths and limitations : \na) Closed vocabulary (LIWC and VADER)  \nb) Open vocabulary (LDA)  \nc) Large Language Models (GPT)  \nBy addressing these questions, the study aims to enhance the accuracy of emotion \nprediction models, potentially enabling closer monitoring of emotional fluctuations in daily life. \n 6 The ultimate goal is to use these improved emotion predictions to inform the delivery of scalable, \nreal-time, and personalized interventions for alleviating high NA states and improving emotion \nregulation abilities.  \nMethod  \nParticipants  \nParticipants were 98 English -speaking adolescents aged 12 -18 (XX female, XX male; mage \n= XX, SD = XX) recruited from the greater Boston area , derived from two larger studies that \nrecruited typically developing (non -anhedonic) adolescents, as well as adolescents with elevated \nlevels of anhedonia.

Emotional states act as \nimmediate alerts to potential benefits or dangers, driving us towards actions that align with our \npersonal goals and away from potential threats (Frijda, 1988) . Their dynamic nature, \ncharacterized by  frequent  shifts over time, significantly impacts mental health. Research shows \nthat both the intensity of emotions and their temporal dynamics can contribute to the \ndevelopment of mood disorders (Fisher et al., n.d.; Houben et al., 2015; Houben & Kuppens, \n2020; Kuppens & Verduyn, 2017; Schoevers et al., 2021) . This is especially important for \nadolescents —a developmental period marked by high negative emotions and rapid mood \nfluctuations , all of which contribute to their elevated risk for mood disorders such as depression \nand anxiety  (Bailen et al., 2019; Bennik et al., 2014; Hollenstein & Lanteigne, 2018) . Given this \nprofound impact, developing effective methods to measure daily emotional changes that are \nspecifically suitable for adolescents is crucial . These measurements could identify both acute \nemotional distress and long er-term maladaptive patterns, serving two key purposes: enabling \ntimely interventions during periods of high negative affect and facilitating targeted intervention \nto address maladaptive emotional patterns. Such methods could  help predict  increased  risk of  \nmood disorder onset, tailor tr eatment plans, and evaluate intervention efficacy, ultimately \ncontributing to improved mental health outcomes.   \nLanguage offers a promising avenue for measuring emotion, as people convey their \nemotional states both explicitly and implicitly through their choice of words and their manner of \nspeaking or writing (Davitz, 2013; Pennebaker et al., 2003) . Language plays a dual role in the \nrealm of emotions, serving not only as a primary tool for expressing and communicating \n 2 emotional states but also as an actively shaping how emotions are experienced (Jablonka et al., \n2012; Lindquist, 2017) . Therefore, the current study aims to explore whether text can be used to \ntrack within -person fluctuation in emotional states.  \nWith the rise of digital communication, people , especially adolescents , now express \nthemselves extensively through text -based interactions, including social media posts, messages, \nand online discussions. This shift has generated an unprecedented volume of language data, \noffering a unique opportunity to study adolescent emotion s on a larger scale (Iliev et al., 2015) . \nAdvances in natural language processing (NLP), a multidisciplinary field combining computer \nscience, artificial intelligence, and linguistics, have enabled researchers to analyze this data \nefficiently and meaningfully  (Hirschberg & Manning, 2015; Manning, 1999) . One key advantage \nof NLP over traditional, manual text analysis is its ability to handle large datasets —such as \nthousands of social media posts or digitized texts —quickly and efficiently. By leveraging these \nadvancements, NLP methods can identify patterns in language use  (e.g.,  sentiment , tone, and \nself-referential quality) , offering real -time insights into emotional states without requiring \nparticipants to actively report their feelings (Carlier et al., 2022; Kahn et al., 2007; Sun et al., \n2020) . Importantly, text -based communication provides insights not only into the intensity of \nemotions but also into the context in which those emotions arise. This contextual information can \nreveal situational factors contributing to emotional experiences, off ering a more nuanced \nunderstanding of emotional processes. While NLP has been used in behavioral science for \ndecades, its increased accessibility and affordability have significantly improved, making it an \nincreasingly popular tool (Feuerriegel et al., 2025) . \nIn recent years, various text analysis tools have emerged (Boyd et al., 2022; Demszky et \nal., 2023; Eichstaedt et al., 2021; Neuendorf, 2017; Rathje et al., 2024; Tausczik & Pennebaker, \n 3 2010; van Loon, 2022) , ranging from basic approaches like counting word frequencies to more \nadvanced methods, such as leveraging large language models (LLMs), each with its own set of \nadvantages and limitations. For example, closed -vocabulary programs such as LIWC \n(Pennebaker, 2001) , use predefined dictionaries to categorize words. While highly interpretable, \ntransparent, and efficient at summarizing concepts, these methods often neglect context, leading \nto potential misinterpretations (Eichstaedt et al., 2021) . In contrast, open -vocabulary approaches, \nsuch as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), and word embedding methods, leverage data -driven \ntechniques to examine a broader spectrum of words and topics (Blei et al., 2003; Griffiths et al., \n2007; Sivakumar et al., 2020) . These methods are better at capturing nuances, addressing \nambiguous word meanings, and are less susceptible to misinterpretations. Limitations of open -\nvocabulary approaches include the need for more technical expertise, larger datasets, and careful \nconsi deration of parameter choices, as well as challenges in interpretability  (Eichstaedt et al\n######################\nOutput:\n"

Notably, 3 of the top 5 variables that differed the most between the High R² and Low R² \ngroups were GPT features  (e.g.. ….) , suggesting that GPT -derived variables may have been \nparticularly effective at enhancing model performance. In contrast, for high -performing ENR \nmodels, the most important predictive features were from LIWC  (e.g., xxxx) , with LIWC \nvariables also showing the largest differences between high - and low -performing mode ls. \nDo Closed Vocabulary, Open Vocabulary, LLM, or Combined Approaches Perform \nBest in Predicting Model Performance?  \nFigure 7 displays the performance metrics for each NLP approach used in the idiographic \nmodels.  When examining the idiographic  predictive performance  of each NLP approach  \nseparately , GPT generally showed  the highest predictive power for negative affect, sadness, \nanger, and nervousness, with R² values around 0.10 for negative affect and sadness, and \nslightly lower for anger and nervousness . These results were comparable to those achieved by \nthe idiographic models that combined all NLP approaches, except in the prediction of \nnervousness where GPT slightly outperformed the combined idiographic model . However, it  \nis important to note that while GPT showed strong R² values, it also had a higher RMSE  \ncompared to  the combined models, suggesting a higher average prediction error despite \n 17 accounting for  more variance in the outcomes . LIWC+VADER and LDA demonstrated \nconsiderably lower predictive power , with the lowest average R² values and fewer significant \nassociations across all three  emotions  and the general scale , especially for anger and \nnervousness. This highlights that the contextual understanding provided by GPT was more \neffective in capturing emotional nuances  compared to the other methods when NLP \napproaches  were tested individually. Overall, while GPT captures variability in negative \naffect (as reflected by R²), its predictions are less precise in terms of exact values (as \nindicated by RMSE). Combined models, which balance capturing variability and minimizing \nprediction errors, offer a more ro bust and reliable approach to emotion prediction.  \nDiscussion  \nIn this study, we combined multiple Natural Language Processing (NLP) approaches to \nexamine whether within -person fluctuations in emotion can be accurately tracked through text \nanalysis.  Recognizing the idiosyncratic nature of emotional communication, we compared \nidiographic models —tailored to individual patterns —with nomothetic models that capture \ncommon trends across groups . By leveraging advanced NLP and machine learning techniques to \ntrack moment -to-moment emotional changes through text analysis, our approach has the \npotential to enhance mental health monitoring, support clinical decision -making, and enable \nearly detection o f distress for timely, personalized interventions.  \nThe results showed  that, overall, nomothetic models  showed high performance in \ncontinuously predicting negative emotions (R2 range: 0.11 -0.38) . These findings align with \nprevious studies demonstrating  the utility of NLP approaches in detecting emotional states  across \nparticipants (Akhtar et al., 2019; Tanana et al., 2021) . However, while nomothetic models \nidentify general trends across participants, they do not necessarily capture nuanced within -person \nfluctuations. When we calculated performance metrics  for each participant individually  \n 18 (nomothetic -idiographic approach ), the mean models' performance declined significantly and \nshowed high between -person variability, indicating that the nomothetic models' ability to track \nwithin -person changes varies considerably from one individual to another . \nWhen we  built separate models for each participant (idiographic models)  and compared \ntheir performance to that of nomothetic -idiographic  we found that the overall predictive \nperformance was comparable between the two approaches. In addition, idiographic models \nrevealed significant variability in the text features predicting emotional states, indicating that \nindividuals express negative emotions in distinct linguistic ways.  This raises an intriguing \nquestion: if individuals differ so markedly in their predictive features, how can a nomothetic \nmodel that captures only general trends perform just as well? One plausible explanation is a \ntrade -off between statistical power and in dividual variation. While idiographic models capture \nunique, person -specific patterns, nomothetic models benefit from larger datasets that enable the \nestimation of multiple, weaker yet stable feature -emotion relationships. In other words, although \nindividu al differences  exist, the robust common patterns identified by the nomothetic approach \nappear sufficient to achieve similar predictive accuracy.  \nSupporting this interpretation, idiographic models provided highly personalized predictions \nfor some individuals (e.g., across all emotions, R² reached up to 0.84 for idiographic models vs. \n0.69 for nomothetic -idiographic models). However, nomothetic model s demonstrated greater \nconsistency across participants, successfully tracking fluctuations in negative emotions for 58% \nof individuals, compared to 48% for idiographic models.  \nWhile we are not aware of studies directly comparing nomothetic and idiographic \napproaches in text analysis, previous research comparing  their effectiveness in tracking mental \nstates using passive sensor data from smartphones and actigraphy, as well as self -reported \n 19 ecological momentary assessment (EMA), has yielded similar results (e.g., Aalbers et al., 2023; \nCheung et al., 2017; Rozet et al., 2019; for exception see Soyster et al., 2022 who found that \nnomothetic models outperfor m idiographic models ).

Instead, multiple linguistic factors contributed to model \nperformance, with GPT -derived ratings emerging as robust predictors. One possible explanation \nis that individual differences, such as affective suppression, affect how em otions are conveyed in \ntext—people with high suppression may mask their emotional states, complicating accurate \npredictions. Future studies should examine whether these participants require larger datasets to \ncapture subtle nuances in their text, or if alt ernative modalities better detect changes in their \nemotional states.  \nThird, the current study compared idiographic and nomothetic approaches, demonstrating \nthat each has its merits. Future studies could explore hybrid approaches that integrate both \nindividual -specific and group -level information, balancing personalization with stat istical power \n 22 to enhance predictive accuracy.  Finally, the text data in our study consisted of responses to \nspecific questions, which may limit the generalizability of our findings to other types of text. \nFuture research should incorporate text from diverse sources —such as social media, \nconversational exchanges, and free -form writing —to determine whether these results extend to \nbroader contexts.   \nIn conclusion, o ur findings highlight the potential of combining NLP approaches to track \nwithin -person emotional fluctuations, demonstrating both the strengths and limitations of \nidiographic and nomothetic models. Nomothetic models effectively capture general trends, this \none-size-fits-all approach may work well for some but not for others.  Idiographic models offer a \nmore nuanced understanding by identifying person -specific features that capture the unique \ncontext of an individual's emotional expression, al though they may suffer from limited data. Our \nresults further indicate that GPT shows promise in capturing fluctuations in emotional states, \nthough further tuning is needed to enhance its precision in predicting specific ratings. Future \nresearch integratin g hybrid modeling strategies —leveraging both group -level patterns and \nindividual differences —could improve predictive accuracy and refine emotion -tracking methods. \nExpanding this work to incorporate diverse text sources and multimodal data streams may \nfurther advance the field. Ultimately, improving the ability to monitor emotions in real -time not \nonly enhances our capacity to study emotional nuances at scale in daily life but also  can help \ndevelop just -in-time interventions that go beyond identifying moments of distress to also \nconsider the specific emotions and contextual factors in which they arise, enabling more \npersonalized and effective interventions . \n  \n 23 Reference s \nAalbers, G., Hendrickson, A.

Unlike predefined dictionaries, LDA generates topics directly from the \\ndata, identifying latent patterns in word usage. Each word is assigned to one or more topics, \\niterating until an optimal balance is reached. This results in a set of posterior probability \\ndistributions, which approximates the likelihood of each word occurring within each topic. This \\nallows LDA to create semantically coherent clusters, overcoming word sense ambiguities by \\ncontextually assigning words to topics. We ran LDA on one - to thr ee-word phrases, rather than \\n 9 individual words alone, so that phrases such as  ‘Summer camp ’ are treated as a single term . We \\nimplemented Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) using distinct approaches for nomothetic and \\nidiographic analyses. For the nomothetic model, we extracted a uniform set of topics across the \\nentire sample. For the idiographic model, we derived personalized topics unique to each \\nindividual.  \\nThe latent topics were extracted from the preprocessed text corpus using probabilistic \\nmodeling with the R package topicmodels (Grün & Hornik, 2011) . For the whole -sample \\n(nomothetic) LDA, before creating the model, we performed the tuning of the algorithm to \\ndefine the number k of topics using ldatuning . To determine the optimal number of topics, we \\nevaluated the quality of topic modeling using three metrics: Griffiths2004 (Griffiths2004), \\nCaoJuan2009  (Cao et al., 2009) , and Arun2010 (Arun et al., 2010) . These metrics included both \\nminimization criteria (CaoJuan2009 and Arun2010), which are optimized when minimized, and \\nmaximization criteria (Griffiths2004), which are optimized when maximized. Additionally, \\nDeveaud2014  provided a reference point that decreases linearly with the number of topics.  We \\nselected six topics based on model fit metrics, as illustrated in Figure 1. The selection of six \\ntopics reflected a balance among these metrics. Table 1 represents  each topic by its 15 most \\nhighly frequent  words, providing a clear semantic foundation for further analysis.  \\nLarge Language Models (GPT).  To generate emotion ratings using large language \\nmodels (LLMs), we employed the Generative Pre -trained Transformer (GPT), an autoregressive \\nAI language model developed by OpenAI. GPT is built on a transformer -based architecture, a \\nneural network design tha t excels at processing sequential data by using self -attention \\nmechanisms to capture contextual relationships across words. This allows GPT to generate \\nhuman -like text by predicting the next word in a sequence based on the prov ided context.  \\n 10 Specifically, we utilized GPT -4, an advanced version pre -trained on a vast dataset \\n(45TB), enabling it to generate coherent sentences and perform various tasks such as writing, \\nanswering questions, and engaging in conversations. In this study, we prompted GPT-4 to rate \\nthe extent to which a participant experienced one of the following emotions: Sadness, Anger, and \\nNervousness, on a scale of 1 to 5 (similar to the scale used in EMA), based on responses to three \\nopen -text questions. See the online supplement for the full prompt used to generate GPT \\nresponses.  \\nData Analysis  \\nModel Specification  \\nWe compared both nomothetic (group -level) and idiographic (individual -level) models in \\ntheir ability to predict variability in negative emotional states within  individuals over time.  We \\nemployed two machine learning approaches to predict negative affect: elastic net regression and \\nrandom forest models. Elastic net regularization (ENR) is a popular regression technique that \\ncombines two types of penalties: ridge and lasso. This combina tion helps address issues related \\nto multicollinearity by constraining the coefficients of correlated variables while also minimizing \\nmodel overfitting. On the other hand, random forest (RF) is an ensemble learning method based \\non decision trees. Unlike EN R, random forest can capture complex nonlinear relationships and \\ninteractions between variables without having to specify them in advance. Given that these two \\nmethods use different strategies for selecting and weighting variables, comparing them can help \\nto determine which one provides the most accurate predictions in a given context.  \\nTo assess model performance and generalizability while minimizing overfitting, we \\nimplemented a nested cross -validation (CV) procedure using the nestedcv  package (Lewis et al., \\n2023). This method consists of two levels of cross -validation:  1. Outer loop: Evaluates the \\n 11 overall performance of the model by repeatedly training and testing on different subsets of the \\ndata.  2. Inner loop: Conducts model selection and hyperparameter tuning to optimize \\nperformance.  We used 10 -fold cross -validation in both the inner and outer loops. In the outer \\nloop, the dataset was divided into ten folds .

The m ain limitations of this \\napproach include a lack of transparency in how inferences were generated and difficulties in \\nreproducing results due to their probabilistic nature (Abdurahman et al., 2024) . For example, \\nalthough LLM -based approaches could predict whether  a person experience s negative emotion s \\nbased on  social media posts, LLMs could not  be used to identify which linguistic cues (such as \\nthe use of pronouns)  predict this experience  (Feuerriegel et al., 2025; Rathje et al., 2024) . In the \\nlatter case, dictionary -based methods  are preferrable. Ultimately, closed - and open -vocabulary \\napproaches, along with advancements in LLMs, provide complementary strengths that \\n 4 significantly enhance our ability to understand psychological states through language. By \\ncombining these methods, researchers can leverage their unique advantages while mitigating \\ntheir limitations, offering a robust alternative to traditional  and relatively cumbersome  self-report \\nmeasures  assessing emotions . \\nDespite the increasing sophistication of these methods, significant gaps remain in the \\ncurrent literature. Most importantly, existing studies on text -based emotion prediction have \\nfocused on exploring between -person differences, primarily identifying which  text features are \\nassociated with individuals experiencing high levels of negative emotions  (e.g., Tackman et al., \\n2019) . These approaches aggregate data across participants and aim to pinpoint common \\nlinguistic markers, such as the use of first -person pronouns or negative sentiment, that are \\nindicative of heightened emotional distress and depression  (Bathina et al., 2021; Funkhouser et \\nal., 2024) . However, this method overlooks both between -person differences in how linguistic \\nmarkers relate to emotions and within -person fluctuations in emotional states . Even when using \\nmultilevel models to predict within -person fluctuations  in emotions , models assumes that the \\nsame linguistic features signal high levels of negative emotions across different individuals \\n(Funkhouser et al., 2024) . Such assumptions fail to account for the fact that language is \\ninherently idiosyncratic, with individuals expressing emotions in unique and context -dependent \\nways. Beck & Jackson, (2022)  demonstrated the importance of idiographic approaches by \\nshowing that the psychological and situational antecedents that predicted future loneliness varied \\nsubstantially across participants, with no two individuals showing the same pattern of predictive \\nfeatures. This highlights the need for personalized models that adapt to the distinctive ways \\npeople express emotions through text, enabling more accurate predictions tailored to each \\nindividual .  \\n 5 Moreover, previous research has typically studied language features in isolation, missing \\nthe potential benefits of combining different language -based methods (Carlier et al., 2022) . This \\nis especially important as features that may be significant for one individual may be not \\nimportant for others. To address these limitations, t his study integrat es diverse language -based \\ntools and leverag es machine learning to develop personalized  models capable of monitoring \\nwithin -person fluctuations in emotional states.  \\nThe Present Study  \\nThe study's primary goal is to evaluate the effectiveness of various text analysis and \\nmachine learning techniques in tracking within -person fluctuations in negative affect (NA) over \\ntime.  Since  individuals express emotions in a variety of linguistic ways, this research aims to \\ndevelop more personalized approaches to emotion tracking.  \\nIn addition to this main objective , we address two key questions:  \\n1) Do idiographic  (individ ual-level ) models outperform nomothetic  (group -level)  models \\nin predicting fluctuations?  This question is motivated by  the fact that  individuals  may \\nexpress emotions through language in highly unique ways.  \\n2) Is combining various NLP approaches beneficial for emotion prediction?  \\nThe research employs and compares three types of Natural Language Processing (NLP) \\napproaches , which, as noted above, have complementary strengths and limitations : \\na) Closed vocabulary (LIWC and VADER)  \\nb) Open vocabulary (LDA)  \\nc) Large Language Models (GPT)  \\nBy addressing these questions, the study aims to enhance the accuracy of emotion \\nprediction models, potentially enabling closer monitoring of emotional fluctuations in daily life. \\n 6 The ultimate goal is to use these improved emotion predictions to inform the delivery of scalable, \\nreal-time, and personalized interventions for alleviating high NA states and improving emotion \\nregulation abilities.  \\nMethod  \\nParticipants  \\nParticipants were 98 English -speaking adolescents aged 12 -18 (XX female, XX male; mage \\n= XX, SD = XX) recruited from the greater Boston area , derived from two larger studies that \\nrecruited typically developing (non -anhedonic) adolescents, as well as adolescents with elevated \\nlevels of anhedonia.

Performance decreased substantially,  with mean R² values in \\nthe range of 0.06 -0.11.  However, there was considerable variability in predictive accuracy across \\nparticipants. For example, when predicting negative affect , R² values ranged from 0.00 to 0.41. \\nFor anger , R² achieved values as high as 0. 69, indicating that for some participants, text features \\nexplained little or no variability in negative affect, while for others, text features explained a \\nsignificant portion of the variability.  \\nThe idiographic approach (individual models) showed similar average performance to the \\nnomothetic –idiographic approach, with mean R² values ranging from 0.06 to 0.10. Figure 3 \\ndemonstrates examples of high vs. low accuracy person specific models. Figure 4 further shows \\nthat, despite this individual variation, the overall trend (represented by the dashed line) \\ndemonstrates a generally positive relationship between predic ted and actual negative affect \\nratings.  The comparison between the nomothetic –idiographic  and idiographic approaches yielded \\nmixed results. Differences emerged in their ability to achieve relatively high performance for \\nspecific individuals and in the proportion of significant associations across all participants . For \\nnegative affect, the idiographic approach exhibited a wider range of R² values across \\nparticipants, implying that this model achieved higher performance for some participants . \\nHowever,  the nomothetic –idiographic approach slightly outperformed it in terms of the \\nproportion of parti cipants with significant associations (55 –58% vs. 43 –48%). A similar pattern \\nwas observed for sadness, suggesting that although person‐specific models can yield higher \\n 15 accuracy for certain participants, the nomothetic –idiographic approach  is more robust for \\nidentifying significant associations across a larger number of individuals.  \\nFor anger, the nomothetic –idiographic approach not only showed greater variability in R² \\nvalues but also identified more significant associations than the idiographic approach. In \\ncontrast, for nervousness, the fully idiographic approach demonstrated both greater variability —\\nallowing some participants to achieve R² values as high as 0.71 —and a larger  number of \\nsignificant associations overall.  \\nWhich Text Features Are Most Predictive in High - vs. Low -Performing Models?  \\nFigure 5 displays the top 10 text features from the four best -performing subject -specific \\nrandom forest models predicting negative affect. Critically, t his visualization demonstrates \\nsignificant variation in the features influencing each participant's model, suggesting differences \\nin the relative importance of features derived from various NLP approaches (LIWC, VADER, \\nLDA, and GPT) across individuals. Though  feature importance varied across individuals, we \\nalso examined whether specific patterns emerged across high - and low -performing participant -\\nspecific models and whether certain NLP approaches provided more influential features in high -\\nperforming models  compared to low -performing ones.  \\nParticipants were divided into groups based on model performance  (R2), with the top 25% \\n(n=25) classified as \\\"High R2\\\"  and the bottom 25% (n=25) as \\\"Low R2.\\\" Feature importance \\nscores were analyzed separately for RF and ENR models. Importantly, p articipants with high - \\nand low -performing models showed no significant difference in number of observation s (RF: \\nHigh mean =72.84 , Low mean=60.64 , t=1. 69, p=0.0 9, CI=-2.31;26.71 , ENR:  High mean =62.72, \\nLow mean=71.36, t=-1.26, p=0. 21, CI=-22.38;5.10) or in mean negative affect (RF: High mean \\n=0.68, Low mean=0.45, t=1.85, p=0.07, CI= -0.02;0.49, ENR:  High mean =0.77, Low mean=0.65, \\n 16 t=0.72, p=0. 47, CI= -0.20;0.43) but for RF high and low performing models  differed significantly \\nin variability (RF: High mean =0.61, Low mean=0.40, t=3.26, p=0.002, CI=0.08;0.33, but not for \\nENR:  High mean =0.59, Low mean=0.50, t=1.29, p=0. 20, CI= -0.05;0.22). Assessment number \\n(\\\"Time\\\") emerged as the most important feature in both RF and ENR models, suggesting that \\ntime-related variability was a relatively strong predictor of NA among  the “High R2” subjects . In \\naddition, as shown in Figure 6, for the RF high -performing models (High R² group), the top 5 \\nimportant variables included features from different approaches (LIWC, GPT, VADER, and \\nLDA). Notably, 3 of the top 5 variables that differed the most between the High R² and Low R² \\ngroups were GPT features  (e.g.. ….) , suggesting that GPT -derived variables may have been \\nparticularly effective at enhancing model performance.

Exclusion criteria included history or current diagnosis of any of the \\nfollowing DSM -5 psychiatric illnesses: major depressive disorder, schizophrenia spectrum or \\nother psychotic disorder, bipolar disorder, substance or alcohol use disorder within the past 12 \\nmonths or lifetime sever e substance or alcohol use disorder , as well as current diagnosis of \\nanorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa  for an additional information about sample inclusion and \\nexclusion criteria see Murray et al., (2023) . \\nProcedure    \\nAll procedures were approved by the Mass General Brigham IRB. Written informed \\nconsent was provided by participants who were 18 years of age, as well as from parents of \\nparticipants who were under 18 years of age, along with the participant’s written informed \\nassent. At the baseline session participants were administered a semi -structured clinical \\ninterview , the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (K -SADS; Kaufman \\net al., 1997) , either in -person or over Zoom . Participants also  completed self -report measures  and \\ninstalled the MetricWire App on their smartphones to complete ecological mom entary \\nassessments (EMAs). EMA surveys were delivered 3-4 times per day whereby participants were \\n 7 randomly signaled during two timeslots ( 4 pm  to 6:30 pm  and 6:30 pm  to 9 pm ) during a 5 -day \\nperiod (Thursday - Monday). A third survey was sent on weekends ( 11 am -4 pm ). Of the \\nparticipants, 39 completed the EMA for four consecutive weeks, while 59 completed it over four \\nweeks on an every -other -week schedule.  \\nEcological Momentary Assessment (EMA): Participants were asked to rate on a 5 -point \\nLikert scale, ranging from 1, “Very slightly or not at all,” to 5, “Extremely”  the extent to which \\nthey were feeling several emotions immediately before they started the assessment . Participants’ \\nnegative affect (NA) included responses for: “sad,” “nervous,” and “angry.” Mean NA was \\nmeasured by averaging the three NA variables.  In addition, participants responded to the \\nfollowing open -ended questions: 1) What were you thinking about right before you started this \\nsurvey?  2) Think about the most enjoyable or happy time  since you completed the last survey  (or \\nif this is your first survey, then the last 24 hours). Very briefly, what happened (1 -2 sentences is \\nfine)?  3) Think about the most stressful or negative time since you completed the last survey  (or \\nif this is your first survey, then the last 24 hours). Very briefly, what happened (1 -2 sentences is \\nfine)?  Participants with fewer than 30 observations were excluded from the analysis.  \\nLanguage Measures  \\nWe used the following strategies to extract text features and generate quantitative \\nsummaries of the language data.  \\nClose vocabulary : For close vocabulary, we extracted features using the Linguistic \\nInquiry and Word Count (LIWC ; Tausczik & Pennebaker, 2010)  and the Valence Aware \\nDictionary and sEntiment Reasoner (VADER ; Hutto & Gilbert, 2014) . LIWC is a computerized \\ntext analysis tool that categorizes words into over 90 linguistic and psychological dimensions \\nbased on an internal dictionary of approximately 6,400 words  (Boyd & Schwartz, 2021) . It \\n 8 calculates the percentage of words that match each predefined category, offering insights into \\nlinguistic structures (e.g., pronouns), psychological constructs (e.g., affect), and broader \\nlanguage patterns (e.g., analytical thinking).  The LIWC has been extensively validated across \\nnumerous studies and is widely used in psychological research to quantify language use patterns \\nassociated with various psychological states and traits. For this study, we used LIWC -22 (Boyd \\net al., 2022) , the latest version of the software, the analyze participants'  responses to the EMA \\nopen questions.  \\nVADER  is a simple rule -based model for general sentiment analysis  optimized for social \\nmedia . It provides four sentiment scores: negative, positive, neutral, and compound (an overall \\nsentiment score from -1 to +1). VADER is particularly effective at handling sentiments \\nexpressed in short, informal text and accounts for factors like punctuation, capita lization, and \\nmodifiers (e.g., intensifiers like \\\"very\\\") that influence the intensity of the sentiment.  Whereas \\nLIWC excels in offering detailed psychological and linguistic insights across a wide range of \\ntexts, VADER is more attuned to detecting sentiment polarity and intensity in social media. \\nFinally , text lengths were extracted as features for each question and included in the models.  \\nOpen vocabulary : Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a probabilistic clustering method \\nthat groups words into topics based on their co -occurrence across a text corpus  (Blei et al., 2003; \\nGriffiths et al., 2007) . Unlike predefined dictionaries, LDA generates topics directly from the \\ndata, identifying latent patterns in word usage. Each word is assigned to one or more topics, \\niterating until an\\n######################\\nOutput:\\n\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Mass General Brigham\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"Mass General Brigham is a healthcare organization involved in the oversight and approval of clinical procedures and studies.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Boston\\\"<|>\\\"geo\\\"<|>\\\"Boston is a geographical area from which participants for the study were recruited, indicating its relevance to the study's demographic.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (K-SADS)\\\"<|>\\\"event\\\"<|>\\\"K-SADS is a semi-structured clinical interview utilized in the baseline session of the study to assess psychiatric conditions among participants.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA)\\\"<|>\\\"event\\\"<|>\\\"EMA refers to a data collection method used in the study where participants rate their emotions multiple times a day.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"LIWC\\\"<|>\\\"technology\\\"<|>\\\"LIWC is a computerized text analysis tool used to assess linguistic and psychological dimensions based on word categorization.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"VADER\\\"<|>\\\"technology\\\"<|>\\\"VADER is a sentiment analysis model that evaluates sentiments expressed in social media and short texts, identifying positive, negative, and neutral sentiments.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"open-ended questions\\\"<|>\\\"event\\\"<|>\\\"Open-ended questions refer to the prompts given to participants to gather qualitative data during the EMA.\\\")##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Mass General Brigham\\\"<|>\\\"Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (K-SADS)\\\"<|>\\\"Mass General Brigham oversees the approval of the K-SADS interview process for participant assessment.\\\"<|>\\\"oversight, clinical assessment\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Mass General Brigham\\\"<|>\\\"Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA)\\\"<|>\\\"Mass General Brigham provides ethical approval for the use of EMA in assessing participant emotional responses.\\\"<|>\\\"oversight, ethical approval\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Boston\\\"<|>\\\"Mass General Brigham\\\"<|>\\\"Boston is the geographical location where Mass General Brigham operates and conducts its studies.\\\"<|>\\\"geographical relevance, research setting\\\"<|>7)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"LIWC\\\"<|>\\\"open-ended questions\\\"<|>\\\"LIWC analyzes responses to the open-ended questions to extract linguistic and psychological features from participant data.\\\"<|>\\\"data analysis, linguistic assessment\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"VADER\\\"<|>\\\"open-ended questions\\\"<|>\\\"VADER is used to assess the sentiment of participant responses to open-ended questions during the EMA.\\\"<|>\\\"sentiment analysis, qualitative assessment\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"content_keywords\\\"<|>\\\"emotion regulation, adolescent study, sentiment analysis, psychological assessment\\\")<|COMPLETE|>\"}]\nMANY entities were missed in the last extraction.

The model was trained on nine folds and tested on \\nthe remaining fold, with this process repeated ten times so that each fold served as the test set \\nonce. This iterative process ensures that pe rformance metrics are evaluated across multiple train -\\ntest splits, providing a robust estimate of generalizability.  Within the inner loop, models were \\ntrained on each training fold, and hyperparameter tuning was conducted by selecting the \\nparameter combination that maximized performance on a validation set. The best -performing \\nmodel was then applied to the corresponding  outer loop test set. By separating hyperparameter \\noptimization from performance evaluation, this approach prevents data leakage and mitigat es the \\nrisk of overfitting.  Nested cross -validation offers several advantages over a simple train -test split. \\nIt allows for efficient use of all available data for both training and validation while reducing the \\nbias introduced by a single, potentially unrepresentative data split. Ad ditionally, by incorporating \\nmultiple train -test iterations, this approach yields a more robust and reliable estimate of model \\nperformance, ensuring that the findings generalize beyond the specific dataset used in training.  \\nAfter iterating through all outer folds, we aggregated the predictions from the left -out test \\nsets and compared them against true values to compute overall predictive performance. We \\nassessed model accuracy using R²  and root mean squared error (RMSE).  We consider RMSE to \\nbe an intuitive metric for assessing predictive accuracy on a target variable measured on a 7 -\\npoint Likert scale, as it accounts for larger errors more heavily and allows us to make statements \\nsuch as, “on average, the model’s predictio n deviates from momentary subjective stress by \\napproximately 0.80 points on a 7 -point scale.”  \\n 12  \\nFirst, we ran nomothetic models that included features extracted from all three NLP \\napproaches, including all subjects  for group -level analysis. These models aimed to identify \\ncommon predictors of negative emotional states at the group level.  To assess how well group -\\nlevel models performed for individual participants , we adopted a nomothetic -idiographic \\napproach, where metrics derived from nomothetic models  such as R2 were calculated separately \\nfor each participant.  \\nFinally, we employed fully idiographic models, building separate models for each \\nparticipant to capture person -specific language -emotion associations . These models focus \\nexclusively on within -person variability, enabling highly individualized predictions. By \\ncomparing the three  abovementioned  approaches, we aimed to understand their relative strengths \\nin predicting negative affect.  In these  idiographic models, variables with low variance were \\nremoved based on standard frequency criteria, where the most comm on value  for that variable  \\ncould not exceed 95% of the total observations.  \\n \\nFeature importance  \\nTo evaluate feature importance, we used SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values, \\nwhich quantify the contribution of each feature to the model's predictions in a consistent and \\ninterpretable manner by assessing how variations in a feature impact the model's output  \\n(Lundberg, 2017) . SHAP values were calculated using the R package s fastshap  and ggbeeswarm , \\nwhich facilitates visualization and interpretation of feature contributions. This method allowed us \\nto identify the relative importance of predictors in the model and their specific effects on the \\npredicted outcomes.  \\n 13 Results  \\nDemographic and clinical characteristics  \\nTable 2 presents the demographic and clinical characteristics of the participants. \\nParticipants  completed an average of XX EMA surveys (s.d. =  XX). Average EMA compliance \\nwas XX% (s.d. =  XX%).  \\nModel performance  \\nModel performance metrics for the nomothetic (one model combinging all  observations \\nfrom all participants), nomothetic -idiographic ( same as above  but calculating performance \\nseparately for each participant), and idiographic (building separate  model s for each individual) \\napproaches using text features extrac ted from the three NLP approaches to predict negative \\naffect are shown in Table 3.  \\nThe nomothetic model s generally outperformed both the nomothetic -idiographic and \\nidiographic models across all emotions. Specifically, when predicting negative affect, sadness, \\nanger, and nervousness, the nomothetic RF model yielded R² values of 0.38, 0.33, 0.20 and 0.24, \\nrespectively, whereas the nomothetic ENR model yielded R² values of 0. 17, 0.14, 0.13 and 0. 11, \\nrespectively . The substantially higher performance of the random forest model can be attributed \\nto its ability to account for participant ID  (grouping by individuals) , which Elastic net cannot. \\nThis inference is supported by the feature importance analysis shown in Figure 2, where \\nparticipant ID emerges as the most important feature in the RF model. This finding points to \\nsubstantial differences between individuals in their average levels of nega tive affect , \\nemphasizing the importance of person -specific modeling approaches to better capture within -\\nperson fluctuations.   \\n 14 Building on this and aligning with the ultimate translational goal of using text to track \\nwithin -person fluctuations in negative emotions (rather than between -person differences), we \\nproceed to evaluate the model's predictive performance for each participant individually \\n(nomothetic -idiographic approach). Performance decreased substantially,  with mean R² values in \\nthe range of 0.06 -0.11.  However, there was considerable variability in predictive accuracy across \\nparticipants. For example, when predicting negative affect , R² values ranged from 0.00 to 0.41.\\n######################\\nOutput:\\n\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Participants\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"Participants are individuals involved in the study, providing data through EMA surveys to assess negative emotional states.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Study\\\"<|>\\\"event\\\"<|>\\\"The Study involves assessing negative emotional states through various modeling approaches based on data collected from participants.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Nomothetic Model\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"The Nomothetic Model aggregates data from all participants to predict negative affect, demonstrating a generalized analysis approach.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Nomothetic-Idiographic Model\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"The Nomothetic-Idiographic Model calculates performance metrics on a per-participant basis while still utilizing group data, blending individual and group-level analysis.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Idiographic Model\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"The Idiographic Model builds separate models for each participant to capture individual variability and emotional responses.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"SHAP Values\\\"<|>\\\"concept\\\"<|>\\\"SHAP Values are used to assess feature importance in models, quantifying the contribution of each feature to the model's predictions.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Random Forest Model\\\"<|>\\\"concept\\\"<|>\\\"The Random Forest Model is a predictive model that outperformed others by effectively accounting for individual participant differences in negative affect.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Elastic Net Model\\\"<|>\\\"concept\\\"<|>\\\"The Elastic Net Model is a predictive approach that struggled relative to the Random Forest Model, as it does not account for participant ID as effectively.\\\")##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Participants\\\"<|>\\\"Study\\\"<|>\\\"Participants contribute data to the Study through EMA surveys, which are used to analyze negative emotional states.\\\"<|>\\\"data collection, research involvement\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Nomothetic Model\\\"<|>\\\"Study\\\"<|>\\\"The Nomothetic Model is a method used in the Study to analyze overall trends in negative affect across all participants.\\\"<|>\\\"analysis method, overall trends\\\"<|>7)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Nomothetic-Idiographic Model\\\"<|>\\\"Study\\\"<|>\\\"The Nomothetic-Idiographic Model is implemented within the Study to blend individual and group-level analyses on negative affect.\\\"<|>\\\"mixed approach, individual and group analysis\\\"<|>6)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Idiographic Model\\\"<|>\\\"Study\\\"<|>\\\"The Idiographic Model is employed in the Study to provide highly individualized predictions of negative emotional states.\\\"<|>\\\"individual focus, prediction of emotions\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Random Forest Model\\\"<|>\\\"Nomothetic Model\\\"<|>\\\"The Random Forest Model is a specific instance of the Nomothetic Model that excels in capturing participant variability in negative affect.\\\"<|>\\\"model performance, individual variability\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Elastic Net Model\\\"<|>\\\"Nomothetic Model\\\"<|>\\\"The Elastic Net Model is compared to the Nomothetic Model in terms of performance when predicting negative affect, where the latter shows better outcomes.\\\"<|>\\\"model comparison, performance assessment\\\"<|>5)##\\n(\\\"content_keywords\\\"<|>\\\"negative affect, modeling approaches, participant variability, predictive performance\\\")<|COMPLETE|>\"}]\nMANY entities were missed in the last extraction.

For example,  Aalbers et al., 2023  used \\nsmartphone passive sensor data to predict stress levels. Their findings revealed that idiographic \\nmodels demonstrated higher accuracy in tracking stress levels for some participants (Spearman’s \\nρ rank -order correlation up to 1 in idiographic models vs. up to .65 in nomothetic models ). \\nHowever, nomothetic models significantly predicted stress for a larger proportion of participants \\n(up to 23.2% for idiographic models vs. up to 55% for nomothetic models ). Rozet et al. (2019) \\nused a comparable method and initi ally found that nomothetic models performed better (i.e., \\nwere more accurate) than idiographic models. However, as more data accumulated, the \\nperformance of the idiographic model eventually equaled and then surpassed that of the \\nnomothetic model, suggestin g that idiographic models may be a better option when sufficient \\ndata is available .   \\nWhen comparing specific NLP approaches, GPT outperformed other models in its ability \\nto monitor fluctuations in emotional states. It achieved R² values comparable to a combined \\nmodel and demonstrated significant associations with reported emotions for 57% of the \\nparticipants. However, it is important to note that despite these strong R² values, GPT also \\nproduced higher RMSE scores compared to the combined models. This discrepancy implies that \\nwhile GPT effectively captures the overall variance in emotional states, it may be less precise in \\npredicting the exact numerical values of these states. Such findings highlight the trade -off \\nbetween capturing broad patterns and maintaining fine -grained precision —a balance that future \\nresearch should aim to optimize , with fine -tuning offering one promising avenue for \\nenhancement.  \\n 20 These  findings are consistent with recent work by Rathje et al., (2024) , which reported \\nhigh correlations (r = 0.66 to 0.75) between GPT -4 outputs and human ratings of emotion , \\nwhereas  dictionary -based approaches showed much lower correlations (r = 0.22 to 0.30). The \\nhigher correlation between GPT and human ratings in Rathje et al. (2024) study is expected as \\nboth GPT and human raters evaluated the emotion directly expressed in text, whereas our study \\naimed to predict participants’ self -reported emotional experiences —a task complicated by the \\nfact that individuals do not always  explicitly communicate their internal states. Thus, while GPT \\nand human annotation in Rathje et al. represent agreement between two raters performing the \\nsame task, our approach required GPT to infer emotions that participants may not have explicitly \\nexpressed.   \\nFrom an applied perspective, GPT's efficiency and minimal training data requirements \\nmake it particularly attractive for studies with limited datasets. However, the model's lack of \\ntransparency and inability to explicitly articulate the rationale behind it s predictions remain \\ncritical limitations that researchers must carefully weigh  (Feuerriegel et al., 2025) . Given these \\nconsiderations, we recommend that researchers thoughtfully evaluate GPT's role in their \\nanalytical pipeline, considering whether to employ it as a standalone tool or integrate it with \\ncomplementary approaches. Future work should focus on deve loping methods that combine \\nGPT's powerful inference capabilities with more transparent analytical approaches, potentially \\noffering a more robust framework for emotion analysis in psychological research.  \\nThis study is the first to use different NLP approaches to directly compare nomothetic and \\nidiographic models for tracking emotional fluctuations.  Yet, f indings of this study should be \\ninterpreted in light of several limitations . First, capturing the nuanced dynamics of emotional \\nexpression typically requires large amounts of data. In everyday interactions, subtle emotional \\n 21 changes may only become apparent with extensive exposure to an individual’s language use —\\nmuch like knowing someone well enables you to discern small shifts in their mood. Therefore, \\nfuture studies should strive to collect larger datasets, potentially sourc ed from daily -life \\ncommunications, to enhance the ability to track and model these nuances.  \\nSecond, the overall predictive accuracy was modest , leaving significant room for \\nimprovement. In addition  to increasing the quantity of data, future research could benefit from \\nincorporating additional modalities (e.g., vocal features, facial expression, passive sensors ) \\nalongside text. Prior studies have shown that combining various modalities can enhance the \\nperformance of nomothetic models of emotion  (see Gandhi et al., 2023  for a review ), this \\nmultimodal approach may also improve idiographic  models. Moreover, future work should \\nexplore whether individuals not only differ in the text features that predict their emotions but \\nalso in the types of modalities that best capture their emotional states.  Relatedly, our analysis of \\ntext features importance across high - and low -performing person -specific models did not reveal a \\nsingle pattern differentiating the groups. Instead, multiple linguistic factors contributed to model \\nperformance, with GPT -derived ratings emerging as robust predictors. One possible explanation \\nis that individual differences, such as affective suppression, affect how em otions are conveyed in \\ntext—people with high suppression may mask their emotional states, complicating accurate \\npredictions. Future studies should examine whether these participants require larger datasets to \\ncapture subtle nuances in their text, or if alt ernative modalities better detect changes in their \\nem\\n######################\\nOutput:\\n\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Aalbers et al., 2023\\\"<|>\\\"person\\\"<|>\\\"Aalbers et al., 2023 is a research study that utilized smartphone passive sensor data to predict stress levels among participants, comparing idiographic and nomothetic models.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Cheung et al., 2017\\\"<|>\\\"person\\\"<|>\\\"Cheung et al., 2017 is a research study that contributes to the understanding of ecological momentary assessment and its impacts on predicting stress levels.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Rozet et al., 2019\\\"<|>\\\"person\\\"<|>\\\"Rozet et al., 2019 conducted a comparable study that initially found nomothetic models more accurate than idiographic models but later noted that idiographic models surpassed nomothetic models with more data.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Soyster et al., 2022\\\"<|>\\\"person\\\"<|>\\\"Soyster et al., 2022 is cited as an exception in the context of research comparing idiographic and nomothetic models in predicting stress levels.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"GPT\\\"<|>\\\"technology\\\"<|>\\\"GPT is an advanced natural language processing model noted for its ability to monitor emotional states, effectively capturing variance in emotional expressions among participants.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Rathje et al., 2024\\\"<|>\\\"person\\\"<|>\\\"Rathje et al., 2024 reported high correlations between outputs from GPT-4 and human ratings of emotion, indicating GPT's effectiveness in emotional analysis compared to traditional methods.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Feuerriegel et al., 2025\\\"<|>\\\"person\\\"<|>\\\"Feuerriegel et al., 2025 emphasized the limitations of GPT, discussing its efficiency and critical limitations such as lack of transparency in its predictions.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Nomothetic models\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Nomothetic models represent a broader statistical approach to predicting emotional states across individuals, showing general trends but not necessarily capturing individual nuances.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Idiographic models\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Idiographic models focus on individual-specific data to predict emotional states, demonstrating potential for higher accuracy when sufficient data is available.\\\")##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Aalbers et al., 2023\\\"<|>\\\"GPT\\\"<|>\\\"Aalbers et al., 2023 utilized smartphone sensor data to predict stress, highlighting the potential use of models like GPT in similar predictive contexts.\\\"<|>\\\"prediction models, data analysis\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Rozet et al., 2019\\\"<|>\\\"Nomothetic models\\\"<|>\\\"Rozet et al.

Emotional states act as \\nimmediate alerts to potential benefits or dangers, driving us towards actions that align with our \\npersonal goals and away from potential threats (Frijda, 1988) . Their dynamic nature, \\ncharacterized by  frequent  shifts over time, significantly impacts mental health. Research shows \\nthat both the intensity of emotions and their temporal dynamics can contribute to the \\ndevelopment of mood disorders (Fisher et al., n.d.; Houben et al., 2015; Houben & Kuppens, \\n2020; Kuppens & Verduyn, 2017; Schoevers et al., 2021) . This is especially important for \\nadolescents —a developmental period marked by high negative emotions and rapid mood \\nfluctuations , all of which contribute to their elevated risk for mood disorders such as depression \\nand anxiety  (Bailen et al., 2019; Bennik et al., 2014; Hollenstein & Lanteigne, 2018) . Given this \\nprofound impact, developing effective methods to measure daily emotional changes that are \\nspecifically suitable for adolescents is crucial . These measurements could identify both acute \\nemotional distress and long er-term maladaptive patterns, serving two key purposes: enabling \\ntimely interventions during periods of high negative affect and facilitating targeted intervention \\nto address maladaptive emotional patterns. Such methods could  help predict  increased  risk of  \\nmood disorder onset, tailor tr eatment plans, and evaluate intervention efficacy, ultimately \\ncontributing to improved mental health outcomes.   \\nLanguage offers a promising avenue for measuring emotion, as people convey their \\nemotional states both explicitly and implicitly through their choice of words and their manner of \\nspeaking or writing (Davitz, 2013; Pennebaker et al., 2003) . Language plays a dual role in the \\nrealm of emotions, serving not only as a primary tool for expressing and communicating \\n 2 emotional states but also as an actively shaping how emotions are experienced (Jablonka et al., \\n2012; Lindquist, 2017) . Therefore, the current study aims to explore whether text can be used to \\ntrack within -person fluctuation in emotional states.  \\nWith the rise of digital communication, people , especially adolescents , now express \\nthemselves extensively through text -based interactions, including social media posts, messages, \\nand online discussions. This shift has generated an unprecedented volume of language data, \\noffering a unique opportunity to study adolescent emotion s on a larger scale (Iliev et al., 2015) . \\nAdvances in natural language processing (NLP), a multidisciplinary field combining computer \\nscience, artificial intelligence, and linguistics, have enabled researchers to analyze this data \\nefficiently and meaningfully  (Hirschberg & Manning, 2015; Manning, 1999) . One key advantage \\nof NLP over traditional, manual text analysis is its ability to handle large datasets —such as \\nthousands of social media posts or digitized texts —quickly and efficiently. By leveraging these \\nadvancements, NLP methods can identify patterns in language use  (e.g.,  sentiment , tone, and \\nself-referential quality) , offering real -time insights into emotional states without requiring \\nparticipants to actively report their feelings (Carlier et al., 2022; Kahn et al., 2007; Sun et al., \\n2020) . Importantly, text -based communication provides insights not only into the intensity of \\nemotions but also into the context in which those emotions arise. This contextual information can \\nreveal situational factors contributing to emotional experiences, off ering a more nuanced \\nunderstanding of emotional processes. While NLP has been used in behavioral science for \\ndecades, its increased accessibility and affordability have significantly improved, making it an \\nincreasingly popular tool (Feuerriegel et al., 2025) . \\nIn recent years, various text analysis tools have emerged (Boyd et al., 2022; Demszky et \\nal., 2023; Eichstaedt et al., 2021; Neuendorf, 2017; Rathje et al., 2024; Tausczik & Pennebaker, \\n 3 2010; van Loon, 2022) , ranging from basic approaches like counting word frequencies to more \\nadvanced methods, such as leveraging large language models (LLMs), each with its own set of \\nadvantages and limitations. For example, closed -vocabulary programs such as LIWC \\n(Pennebaker, 2001) , use predefined dictionaries to categorize words. While highly interpretable, \\ntransparent, and efficient at summarizing concepts, these methods often neglect context, leading \\nto potential misinterpretations (Eichstaedt et al., 2021) . In contrast, open -vocabulary approaches, \\nsuch as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), and word embedding methods, leverage data -driven \\ntechniques to examine a broader spectrum of words and topics (Blei et al., 2003; Griffiths et al., \\n2007; Sivakumar et al., 2020) . These methods are better at capturing nuances, addressing \\nambiguous word meanings, and are less susceptible to misinterpretations. Limitations of open -\\nvocabulary approaches include the need for more technical expertise, larger datasets, and careful \\nconsi deration of parameter choices, as well as challenges in interpretability  (Eichstaedt et al\\n######################\\nOutput:\\n\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Natural Language Processing\\\"<|>\\\"technology\\\"<|>\\\"Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a multidisciplinary field combining computer science, artificial intelligence, and linguistics, enabling the analysis of language data to track emotions effectively.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Adolescents\\\"<|>\\\"person\\\"<|>\\\"Adolescents are young individuals who often face high negative emotions and rapid mood fluctuations, making them a focus for research on emotional health.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Mood Disorders\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Mood Disorders are mental health conditions, such as depression and anxiety, that can be significantly influenced by emotional states, particularly in adolescents.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Digital Communication\\\"<|>\\\"event\\\"<|>\\\"Digital Communication refers to the extensive use of text-based interactions on platforms like social media, which has risen dramatically and generated vast amounts of language data.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Behavioral Science\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Behavioral Science is the study of human actions and interactions, where NLP has increasingly been applied to understand emotional processes.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Language Data\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Language Data consists of written text used in interactions, offering insights into emotional states when analyzed through NLP.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Text Analysis Tools\\\"<|>\\\"technology\\\"<|>\\\"Text Analysis Tools are various approaches used to analyze written content, ranging from simple word count methods to complex models like LDA and large language models.\\\")##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Natural Language Processing\\\"<|>\\\"Adolescents\\\"<|>\\\"Natural Language Processing techniques are designed to analyze the language used by adolescents in digital communication to track their emotional fluctuations.\\\"<|>\\\"emotion tracking, analysis\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Digital Communication\\\"<|>\\\"Adolescents\\\"<|>\\\"The rise of Digital Communication is particularly relevant for Adolescents, who express their emotions frequently through text-based interactions.\\\"<|>\\\"communication patterns, emotional expression\\\"<|>7)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Natural Language Processing\\\"<|>\\\"Mood Disorders\\\"<|>\\\"Natural Language Processing can help track emotional changes, which is crucial in identifying and addressing Mood Disorders in Adolescents.\\\"<|>\\\"emotional health, intervention\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Text Analysis Tools\\\"<|>\\\"Natural Language Processing\\\"<|>\\\"Text Analysis Tools are a part of Natural Language Processing and are used to analyze language data effectively, impacting emotional studies.\\\"<|>\\\"data analysis, emotional insights\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Behavioral Science\\\"<|>\\\"Natural Language Processing\\\"<|>\\\"Behavioral Science increasingly utilizes Natural Language Processing methods to understand emotional processes through language data.\\\"<|>\\\"research application, emotional understanding\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"content_keywords\\\"<|>\\\"emotional tracking, adolescents, digital communication, mood disorders, behavioral science, language analysis\\\")<|COMPLETE|>\"}]\nMANY entities were missed in the last extraction.

Notably, 3 of the top 5 variables that differed the most between the High R² and Low R² \\ngroups were GPT features  (e.g.. ….) , suggesting that GPT -derived variables may have been \\nparticularly effective at enhancing model performance. In contrast, for high -performing ENR \\nmodels, the most important predictive features were from LIWC  (e.g., xxxx) , with LIWC \\nvariables also showing the largest differences between high - and low -performing mode ls. \\nDo Closed Vocabulary, Open Vocabulary, LLM, or Combined Approaches Perform \\nBest in Predicting Model Performance?  \\nFigure 7 displays the performance metrics for each NLP approach used in the idiographic \\nmodels.  When examining the idiographic  predictive performance  of each NLP approach  \\nseparately , GPT generally showed  the highest predictive power for negative affect, sadness, \\nanger, and nervousness, with R² values around 0.10 for negative affect and sadness, and \\nslightly lower for anger and nervousness . These results were comparable to those achieved by \\nthe idiographic models that combined all NLP approaches, except in the prediction of \\nnervousness where GPT slightly outperformed the combined idiographic model . However, it  \\nis important to note that while GPT showed strong R² values, it also had a higher RMSE  \\ncompared to  the combined models, suggesting a higher average prediction error despite \\n 17 accounting for  more variance in the outcomes . LIWC+VADER and LDA demonstrated \\nconsiderably lower predictive power , with the lowest average R² values and fewer significant \\nassociations across all three  emotions  and the general scale , especially for anger and \\nnervousness. This highlights that the contextual understanding provided by GPT was more \\neffective in capturing emotional nuances  compared to the other methods when NLP \\napproaches  were tested individually. Overall, while GPT captures variability in negative \\naffect (as reflected by R²), its predictions are less precise in terms of exact values (as \\nindicated by RMSE). Combined models, which balance capturing variability and minimizing \\nprediction errors, offer a more ro bust and reliable approach to emotion prediction.  \\nDiscussion  \\nIn this study, we combined multiple Natural Language Processing (NLP) approaches to \\nexamine whether within -person fluctuations in emotion can be accurately tracked through text \\nanalysis.  Recognizing the idiosyncratic nature of emotional communication, we compared \\nidiographic models —tailored to individual patterns —with nomothetic models that capture \\ncommon trends across groups . By leveraging advanced NLP and machine learning techniques to \\ntrack moment -to-moment emotional changes through text analysis, our approach has the \\npotential to enhance mental health monitoring, support clinical decision -making, and enable \\nearly detection o f distress for timely, personalized interventions.  \\nThe results showed  that, overall, nomothetic models  showed high performance in \\ncontinuously predicting negative emotions (R2 range: 0.11 -0.38) . These findings align with \\nprevious studies demonstrating  the utility of NLP approaches in detecting emotional states  across \\nparticipants (Akhtar et al., 2019; Tanana et al., 2021) . However, while nomothetic models \\nidentify general trends across participants, they do not necessarily capture nuanced within -person \\nfluctuations. When we calculated performance metrics  for each participant individually  \\n 18 (nomothetic -idiographic approach ), the mean models' performance declined significantly and \\nshowed high between -person variability, indicating that the nomothetic models' ability to track \\nwithin -person changes varies considerably from one individual to another . \\nWhen we  built separate models for each participant (idiographic models)  and compared \\ntheir performance to that of nomothetic -idiographic  we found that the overall predictive \\nperformance was comparable between the two approaches. In addition, idiographic models \\nrevealed significant variability in the text features predicting emotional states, indicating that \\nindividuals express negative emotions in distinct linguistic ways.  This raises an intriguing \\nquestion: if individuals differ so markedly in their predictive features, how can a nomothetic \\nmodel that captures only general trends perform just as well? One plausible explanation is a \\ntrade -off between statistical power and in dividual variation. While idiographic models capture \\nunique, person -specific patterns, nomothetic models benefit from larger datasets that enable the \\nestimation of multiple, weaker yet stable feature -emotion relationships. In other words, although \\nindividu al differences  exist, the robust common patterns identified by the nomothetic approach \\nappear sufficient to achieve similar predictive accuracy.  \\nSupporting this interpretation, idiographic models provided highly personalized predictions \\nfor some individuals (e.g., across all emotions, R² reached up to 0.84 for idiographic models vs. \\n0.69 for nomothetic -idiographic models). However, nomothetic model s demonstrated greater \\nconsistency across participants, successfully tracking fluctuations in negative emotions for 58% \\nof individuals, compared to 48% for idiographic models.  \\nWhile we are not aware of studies directly comparing nomothetic and idiographic \\napproaches in text analysis, previous research comparing  their effectiveness in tracking mental \\nstates using passive sensor data from smartphones and actigraphy, as well as self -reported \\n 19 ecological momentary assessment (EMA), has yielded similar results (e.g., Aalbers et al., 2023; \\nCheung et al., 2017; Rozet et al., 2019; for exception see Soyster et al., 2022 who found that \\nnomothetic models outperfor m idiographic models ).

Future \\nresearch integratin g hybrid modeling strategies —leveraging both group -level patterns and \\nindividual differences —could improve predictive accuracy and refine emotion -tracking methods. \\nExpanding this work to incorporate diverse text sources and multimodal data streams may \\nfurther advance the field. Ultimately, improving the ability to monitor emotions in real -time not \\nonly enhances our capacity to study emotional nuances at scale in daily life but also  can help \\ndevelop just -in-time interventions that go beyond identifying moments of distress to also \\nconsider the specific emotions and contextual factors in which they arise, enabling more \\npersonalized and effective interventions . \\n  \\n 23 Reference s \\nAalbers, G., Hendrickson, A.
