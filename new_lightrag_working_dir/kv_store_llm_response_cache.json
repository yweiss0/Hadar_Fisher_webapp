For example, if a participant responds with \n\"none\" to the question about a stressful event, this may indicate lower negative emotions, whereas \nresponding with \"none\" to a question about an enjoyable event may indicate lower positive emotions. \n \nProvide ratings on a scale of 1 to 5 for each emotion and for the general scales, along with a confidence level \nfrom 0 to 100 for each rating. Ensure that the output includes the \"time\" variable from the input. Answer only \nwith ratings and confidence levels; do not include explanations. \n \nParameters: \n \n    participant_id (str): The unique identifier for the participant. \n    time (str): The time point when the responses were recorded. \n    thought (str): The participant's response to what they were thinking just before. \n    stresstext (str): The participant's response to the most stressful event in the last few hours. \n    enjoytext (str): The participant's response to the most enjoyable event in the last few hours. \nReturns: \n \ndict: A dictionary containing the participant's ID, time, their responses, emotion ratings, and confidence \nlevels. \nExample: \n \n        Input: \n            participant_id = \"K23101\" \n            time = \"5\" \n            thought = \"College applications\" \n            stresstext = \"Getting ditched by a friend\" \n            enjoytext = \"Hanging out with my friends at lunch\" \n \n        Output: \n            { \n                'id': \"K23101\", \n                'time': \"5\", \n                'thought': \"College applications\", \n                'stresstext': \"Getting ditched by a friend\", \n                'enjoytext': \"Hanging out with my friends at lunch\", \n                'ratings': { \n                    'Sad': 2, \n                    'Nervous': 1, \n                    'Angry': 2, \n                    'na': 1.67 \n                }, \n                'confidence': { \n                    'Sad': 90, \n                    'Nervous': 70, \n                    'Angry': 75, \n                } \n            }    \"\"\" \n 39Section 3: Nested CV procedure \nThis method consists of two levels of cross-validation: 1. Outer loop: Evaluates the \noverall performance of the model by repeatedly training and testing on different subsets of the \ndata. 2. Inner loop: Conducts model selection and hyperparameter tuning to optimize \nperformance. We used 10-fold cross-validation in both the inner and outer loops. In the outer \nloop, the dataset was divided into ten folds. The model was trained on nine folds and tested on \nthe remaining fold, with this process repeated ten times so that each fold served as the test set \nonce. This iterative process ensures that performance metrics are evaluated across multiple train-\ntest splits, providing a robust estimate of generalizability. Within the inner loop, models were \ntrained on each training fold, and hyperparameter tuning was conducted by selecting the \nparameter combination that maximized performance on a validation set. The best-performing \nmodel was then applied to the corresponding outer loop test set. By separating hyperparameter \noptimization from performance evaluation, this approach prevents data leakage and mitigates the \nrisk of overfitting. Nested cross-validation offers several advantages over a simple train-test split. \nIt allows for efficient use of all available data for both training and validation while reducing the \nbias introduced by a single, potentially unrepresentative data split. Additionally, by incorporating \nmultiple train-test iterations, this approach yields a more robust and reliable estimate of model \nperformance, ensuring that the findings generalize beyond the specific dataset used in training. \nAfter iterating through all outer folds, we aggregated the predictions from the left-out test sets \nand compared them against true values to compute overall predictive performance.    \n 40Section 4: Which Text Features Are Most Predictive in High- vs. Low-Performing Models? \nThough feature importance varied across individuals, we also examined whether specific \npatterns emerged across high- and low-performing participant-specific models. Our goal was to \ndetermine if these patterns could reveal characteristics of participants for whom language is more \nor less predictive of emotional states. Participants were divided into groups based on model \nperformance (R2), with the top 25% (n=25) classified as \"High R2\" and the bottom 25% (n=25) \nas \"Low R2.\" Feature importance scores were analyzed separately for RF and ENR models. \nImportantly, participants with high- and low-performing models showed no significant \ndifference in number of observations (RF: High mean =72.84, Low mean=60.64, t=1.69, p=0.09, \nCI=-2.31;26.71, ENR: High mean =62.72, Low mean=71.36, t=-1.26, p=0.21, CI=-22.38;5.10) or in \nmean negative affect (RF: High mean =0.68, Low mean=0.45, t=1.85, p=0.07, CI=-0.02;0.49, ENR: \nHighmean =0.77, Low mean=0.65, t=0.72, p=0.47, CI=-0.20;0.43).

In everyday interactions, subtle emotional changes \nmay only become apparent with extensive exposure to an individual’s language use, much like \nknowing someone well enables you to discern small shifts in their mood. Therefore, future studies \n 15should strive to collect larger within-person datasets, potentially sourced from daily-life \ncommunications, to enhance the ability to track and model these nuances. \nSecond, the overall predictive accuracy was modest, leaving significant room for improvement. \nIn addition to increasing the quantity of data, future research could benefit from incorporating \nadditional modalities (e.g., vocal features, facial expression, passive sensors from smartphones or \nwearables such as smartwatches or smart ring, which are becoming increasingly popular) alongside \ntext. Prior studies have shown that combining various modalities can enhance the performance of \nnomothetic models of emotion (see Gandhi et al., 2023 for a review), this multimodal approach may \nalso improve idiographic models. Moreover, future work should explore whether individuals not only \ndiffer in the text features that predict their emotions but also in the types of modalities that best capture \ntheir emotional states.  For example, individual differences, such as tendency to use affective \nsuppression, may influence how emotions are conveyed in text, with greater suppression potentially \nleading to lower model performance. Future studies should examine whether these participants require \nlarger datasets to capture subtle nuances in their text, or if alternative modalities (e.g., passive sensor) \nbetter detect changes in their emotional states. \nThird, the current study compared idiographic and nomothetic approaches, demonstrating that \neach has its merits. Future studies could explore hybrid approaches that integrate both individual-\nspecific and group-level information, balancing personalization with statistical power to enhance \npredictive accuracy. Finally, the text data in our study consisted of responses to specific questions, \nwhich may limit the generalizability of our findings to other types of text (e.g., text messages and \nsocial media posts). Future research should incorporate text from diverse sources such as social media, \nconversational exchanges, and free-form writing, to determine whether these results extend to broader \ncontexts.  \n 16Conclusion \nIn conclusion, our findings highlight the potential of combining NLP approaches to track within-\nperson emotional fluctuations, demonstrating both the strengths and limitations of idiographic and \nnomothetic models. Nomothetic models effectively capture general trends, making them useful for \nbroad applications. In contrast, idiographic models provide a more nuanced understanding by \nidentifying person-specific features that reflect an individual's unique emotional expression, though \nthey require large within-person datasets to model these patterns reliably. Rather than a one-size-fits-\nall approach, our results suggest that selecting the best approach for each participant can enhance \npredictive accuracy. Expanding this work to incorporate diverse text sources and multimodal data \nstreams (e.g., integrating social media posts, speech transcripts, facial expressions, physiological \nsignals, or smartphone sensor data) may further advance the field. \nUltimately, improving the ability to monitor emotions in real-time not only enhances our ability \nto study emotional phenomena as they unfold in daily life but also can help inform the development \nand deployment of just-in-time (JIT) interventions that go beyond identifying moments of distress to \nalso consider the specific emotions and contextual factors in which they arise, enabling more \npersonalized and effective interventions for youth. \n 17Method \nParticipants \nParticipants were derived from two larger studies that recruited adolescents with elevated levels \nof anhedonia, as well as typically developing (non-anhedonic) adolescents. They included 97 English-\nspeaking adolescents aged 12-18 (75 female, 22 male; M age = 16.2, SD = 1.9) recruited from the \ngreater Boston area. Participants were excluded based on a history or current diagnosis of any of the \nfollowing DSM-5 psychiatric illnesses: schizophrenia spectrum or other psychotic disorder, bipolar \ndisorder, substance or alcohol use disorder within the past 12 months or lifetime severe substance or \nalcohol use disorder. Participants were also excluded based on current diagnosis of anorexia nervosa or \nbulimia nervosa or if they had a neurodevelopmental disorder that would interfere with study tasks. \nDue to the neuroimaging component of this study, additional exclusion criteria included fMRI \ncontraindications. For additional information about sample inclusion and exclusion criteria see Murray \net al., (2023).                                                                                                             \nProcedure   \nAll procedures were approved by the Mass General Brigham IRB. Participants who were 18 \nyears of age provided written informed consent; participants who were under 18 provided written \nassent, with their parents providing written consent. At the baseline session, either in-person or over \nZoom, participants were administered a semi-structured clinical interview, the Kiddie Schedule for \nAffective Disorders and Schizophrenia (K-SADS; Kaufman et al., 1997), and completed self-report \nmeasures. Following the baseline session, participants installed the MetricWire app on their \nsmartphones to complete ecological momentary assessments (EMAs).

This rich \ninformation can be used to create person-specific profiles that enable us to identify the specific \ncontexts in which negative emotions arise, providing insights that can be used to personalize \ninterventions. A heatmap of the feature importance across participants and feature importance figures \nfor each participant, outcome, and ML model are available on the Web app (\"Feature importance \nheatmap\" and \"Feature importance per participant\"). Details on the differences in predictive text \nfeatures between high- and low-performing models can be found in the Supplement ( Section S4  and \nFig. S3). \nDo Closed Vocabulary, Open Vocabulary, LLM, or Combined Approaches Perform Best in \nPredicting Negative Emotions? \nFig. 6 displays the performance metrics for each NLP approach used in the idiographic models. \nWhen examining the idiographic predictive performance of each NLP approach separately, GPT \n 10generally showed better performance for negative affect, sadness, anger, and nervousness, with R² \nvalues around 0.10 for negative affect and sadness, and slightly lower for anger and nervousness. \nThese results were comparable to those achieved by the idiographic models that combined all NLP \napproaches (see Table 3 for the combined model results), except in the prediction of nervousness \nwhere GPT slightly outperformed the combined idiographic model. However, it is important to note \nthat while GPT had relatively strong R² values, it also had a higher RMSE compared to the \ncombined models, suggesting a higher average prediction error despite accounting for more \nvariance in the outcomes. LIWC+VADER and LDA each demonstrated poorer predictive \nperformance, with the lowest average R² values and fewer significant associations across all \nemotions, especially for anger and nervousness. This highlights that the contextual understanding \nprovided by GPT was more effective in capturing within-person emotional fluctuations compared to \nthe other methods when NLP approaches were tested individually. Overall, while GPT captures \nvariability in negative affect (as reflected by R²), its predictions are less precise in terms of exact \nvalues (as indicated by RMSE). Combined models, which balance capturing variability and \nminimizing prediction errors, offer a more robust and reliable approach to emotion prediction. \nEvaluating Best Performing Models for Each Individual \n          To investigate the effectiveness of personalized models, we identified the best-performing \npredictive model for each of the 97 participants. Using this flexible approach, the vast majority (90.7-\n94.8%) of the participants showed a significant correlation between predicted and observed (actual) \nemotion scores. The table detailing the best model for each participant and each emotion outcome can \nbe found in the Web app under \"Best model performance\". Fig. S4 shows the distribution of best-\nperforming models across participants. Idiographic models were most frequently selected for all \noutcomes except for Anger, where nomothetic models performed best for 44.3% of the participants. \nElastic Net showed the best performance for most participants across outcomes, followed by Random \nForest. For NLP approaches, the model combining all text features outperformed for most of the \n 11participants (52.6-59.8%). Interestingly, though GPT showed the highest mean R² scores, it was \nchosen as the best model for only a relatively small portion of the participants (11.3-19.6%). \nAre Models Emotion-Specific? \nTo examine whether our models captured emotion-specific signals rather than general negative \naffect, we compared the extent to which each emotion-specific model (both Random Forest and Elastic \nNet) predicted each observed emotion. Specifically, for each observed emotion outcome (NA, Sad, \nAngry, and Nervous), we calculated R² and RMSE between the observed and the predicted emotion, \neither matching (e.g., observed and predicted sadness) or mismatching (e.g., observed sadness and \npredicted anger). As shown in Fig. S4-S7 (see also in the web app under “Best Model Performance”), \nwhich display box plots of the distribution of R² and RMSE for each emotion, overall, and consistent \nwith the interpretation that the models have emotion-specific signals, the matched predictions showed \nhigher R² and lower RMSE than mismatched predictions, indicating that the models capture unique, \nemotion-specific variance. However, for RMSE, we sometimes observed better performance for NA \nrelative to the specific emotions, suggesting that the signals underlying broad negative affect might be \nmore robust or reliable relative to single emotion ratings. \nDiscussion  \nIn this study, we combined multiple Natural Language Processing (NLP) approaches to examine \nwhether within-person fluctuations in emotion can be accurately tracked through text analysis. \nRecognizing the idiosyncratic nature of emotional communication, we compared idiographic models, \ntailored to individual patterns, with nomothetic models that capture common trends across groups.  The \nleveraging of advanced NLP and machine learning techniques to track moment-to-moment emotional \nchanges through text analysis has the potential to enhance mental health monitoring, support clinical \ndecision-making, and enable early detection of distress for timely, personalized interventions. \nThe results showed that, overall, group-level nomothetic models showed high performance in \ncontinuously predicting negative emotions (R2 range: 0.11-0.38). These findings align with previous \n 12studies demonstrating the utility of NLP approaches in detecting emotional states across participants \n39,40. However, since these studies primarily focused on identifying emotional states at the between-\nperson level, rather than capturing within-person  fluctuations, their high performance does not \nnecessarily indicate an ability to accurately track moment-to-moment emotion fluctuation within \nindividuals. When we calculated performance metrics for each participant individually, the mean \nmodels' performance declined significantly and showed\n######################\nOutput:\n"

At the baseline session, either in-person or over \nZoom, participants were administered a semi-structured clinical interview, the Kiddie Schedule for \nAffective Disorders and Schizophrenia (K-SADS; Kaufman et al., 1997), and completed self-report \nmeasures. Following the baseline session, participants installed the MetricWire app on their \nsmartphones to complete ecological momentary assessments (EMAs). Of the participants, 39 \ncompleted the EMA for four consecutive weeks; for the first 5 days, surveys were delivered 2-3 times \nper day in the afternoon and evening, and for the remaining 25 days, surveys were delivered 4 times \nper day. The other 58 participants completed the EMA in 5-day (Thursday through Monday) blocks \nevery other week, with 2-3 survey prompts per day, for a median of 17 weeks.  \n 18Measures \nEcological Momentary Assessment (EMA)  \nParticipants were asked to rate on a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from 0, “Very slightly or not at \nall,” to 4, “Extremely” the extent to which they were feeling several emotions immediately before they \nstarted the assessment. Participants’ negative affect (NA) included responses for: “sad,” “nervous,” \nand “angry.” Mean NA was measured by averaging the three NA variables. In addition, participants \nresponded to the following open-ended questions: 1) What were you thinking about right before you \nstarted this survey? 2) Think about the most enjoyable or happy time since you completed the last \nsurvey (or if this is your first survey, then the last 24 hours). Very briefly, what happened (1-2 \nsentences is fine)? 3) Think about the most stressful or negative time since you completed the last \nsurvey (or if this is your first survey, then the last 24 hours). Very briefly, what happened (1-2 \nsentences is fine)? Participants with fewer than 30 observations were excluded from the analysis.  \nLanguage Measures  \nWe used the following strategies to extract text features and generate quantitative summaries of \nthe language data. \nClose vocabulary.  For close vocabulary (dictionary-based approach), we extracted features \nusing the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC; Tausczik & Pennebaker, 2010) and the Valence \nAware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner (VADER; Hutto & Gilbert, 2014). LIWC is a computerized \ntext analysis tool that categorizes words into over 90 linguistic and psychological dimensions based on \nan internal dictionary of approximately 6,400 words 48. It calculates the percentage of words that match \neach predefined category, offering insights into linguistic structures (e.g., pronouns), psychological \nconstructs (e.g., affect), and broader language patterns (e.g., analytical thinking). The LIWC has been \nextensively validated across numerous studies and is widely used in psychological research to quantify \nlanguage use patterns associated with various psychological states and traits. For this study, we used \n 19LIWC-22 23, the latest version of the software, the analyze participants' responses to the EMA open \nquestions. \nVADER is a simple rule-based model for general sentiment analysis optimized for social media. \nIt provides four sentiment scores: negative, positive, neutral, and compound (an overall sentiment \nscore from -1 to +1). VADER is particularly effective at handling sentiments expressed in short, \ninformal text and accounts for factors like punctuation, capitalization, and modifiers (e.g., intensifiers \nlike \"very\") that influence the intensity of the sentiment. Whereas LIWC excels in offering detailed \npsychological and linguistic insights across a wide range of texts, VADER is more attuned to detecting \nsentiment polarity and intensity in social media. Finally, text lengths were extracted as features for \neach question and included in the models. \nOpen vocabulary.  Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a probabilistic clustering method that \nidentifies topics based on word co-occurrence rather than relying on predefined dictionaries 31,32. This \napproach allows LDA to group semantically related words while considering context, reducing word \nsense ambiguity. The latent topics were extracted from the preprocessed text corpus using probabilistic \nmodeling with the R package topicmodels  49. In our study, we implemented LDA using two distinct \napproaches for nomothetic and idiographic analyses. For the nomothetic model, we extracted a \nuniform set of topics across the entire sample. For the idiographic model, we applied LDA separately \nfor each individual, identifying topics based on their unique word usage patterns. To interpret the \nextracted nomothetic  topics, Table 1 presents the 15 most frequent words per topic, offering a \nsemantic representation of the clustering. Furthermore, Fig. S2 depicts the distribution of LDA-derived \ntopics across participants, highlighting variations in topic prevalence within the dataset. Details on \ntopic selection, model tuning, and evaluation metrics are provided in the Supplement.  \nGenerative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT).  To generate emotion ratings using large \nlanguage models (LLMs), we used GPT, a deep learning-based AI language model developed by \nOpenAI. GPT is built on a transformer-based architecture, a neural network design that excels at \n 20processing sequential data by using self-attention mechanisms to capture contextual relationships \nacross words. This allows GPT to generate human-like text by predicting the next word in a sequence \nbased on the provided context. Specifically, we used GPT-4, an advanced version pre-trained on a vast \ndataset (45TB), enabling it to generate coherent sentences and perform various tasks such\n######################\nOutput:\n"

To uncover the utility of text-based approaches for \nemotion prediction, this study compares nomothetic and idiographic modeling approaches for \npredicting adolescents’ daily negative affect (NA) using text features. It also evaluates different \nNatural Language Processing (NLP) techniques in capturing within-person emotion fluctuations. We \nanalyzed ecological momentary assessment (EMA) text responses from 98 adolescents (ages 14-18, \n77.3 % female, 22.7% male, N EMA=7,680). Text features were extracted using dictionary-based \napproach, topic modeling, and GPT-derived emotion ratings. Random Forest and Elastic Net \nRegression models predicted NA from these text features, comparing nomothetic (group-level) and \nidiographic (individualized) approaches. All key findings, interactive visualizations, and model \ncomparisons are available via the website: https://emotracknlp.streamlit.app/ . Idiographic models \ncombining text features from different NLP approaches showed the best performance: they performed \ncomparably to nomothetic models in R² but yielded lower prediction error (Root Mean Squared Error), \nimproving within-person precision. Importantly, there was substantial between-person differences in \nmodel performance and predictive linguistic features. When selecting the best-performing model for \neach participant, significant correlations between predicted and observed emotion scores were found \nfor 90.7–94.8% of participants. Our findings suggest that while nomothetic models offer initial \nscalability, idiographic models may provide greater predictive precision with sufficient within-person \ndata. A flexible, personalized approach that selects the optimal model for each individual may enhance \nemotion monitoring, while leveraging text data to provide contextual insights. \n \nEmotions play a fundamental role in human life, serving as essential cues that influence our \nactions and interactions with the environment 1. Emotional states act as immediate alerts to potential \nbenefits or dangers, driving us towards actions that align with our personal goals and away from Commented [HF1]: The first part (excluding the method) \nup to 5000 words. No title to the introduction.  \n 3potential threats 2. Research shows that not only the intensity of emotions but also their temporal \ndynamics can contribute to the development of mood disorders 3–7. This is especially important for \nadolescents, a developmental period marked by increases in the frequency of negative emotional states, \nwhich may contribute to their elevated risk for depression 8–10. Developing effective methods to \nmeasure daily emotional changes that are specifically suitable for adolescents is crucial. These \nmeasurements could identify both acute emotional distress and longer-term maladaptive patterns in \nemotions, serving two key purposes: enabling timely interventions during periods of high negative \naffect and facilitating targeted intervention to address maladaptive emotional patterns. Such methods \ncould help predict increased risk of affective disorder onset (such as depression), which could inform \nthe timely and targeted delivery of preventative interventions, ultimately contributing to improved \nmental health outcomes.  \nLanguage offers a promising avenue for measuring emotion, as people convey their emotional \nstates both explicitly and implicitly through their choice of words and their manner of speaking or \nwriting 11,12. Language plays a dual role in the realm of emotions, serving not only as a primary tool for \nexpressing and communicating emotional states but also as an actively shaping how emotions are \nexperienced 13,14. Therefore, the current study aims to explore whether text can be used to track within-\nperson fluctuation in emotional states. \nWith the rise of digital communication, people, especially adolescents, now express themselves \nextensively through text-based interactions, including social media posts, messages, and online \ndiscussions. This shift has generated an unprecedented volume of language data, offering a unique \nopportunity to study adolescent emotions on a larger scale 15,16. Advances in natural language \nprocessing (NLP), a multidisciplinary field combining computer science, artificial intelligence, and \nlinguistics, have enabled researchers to analyze this data efficiently and meaningfully 17,18. While NLP \nhas been used in behavioral science for decades, its accessibility and affordability have significantly \n 4improved, making it an increasingly popular tool 19. One key advantage of NLP over traditional, \nmanual text analysis is its ability to handle large datasets—such as thousands of social media posts or \ndigitized texts—quickly and efficiently. By leveraging these advancements, NLP methods can identify \npatterns in language use (e.g., sentiment, tone, and self-referential quality), offering real-time insights \ninto emotional states without requiring participants to actively report their feelings 20–22. Importantly, \ntext-based communication provides insights not only into the intensity of emotions but also into the \ncontext in which those emotions arise. This contextual information can reveal situational factors \ncontributing to emotional experiences, offering a more nuanced understanding of emotional processes.  \nIn recent years, various text analysis tools have emerged 23–29, ranging from basic approaches \nlike counting word frequencies to more advanced methods, such as leveraging large language models \n(LLMs), each with its own set of advantages and limitations. For example, closed-vocabulary \nprograms (i.e., dictionary-based approach)1 such as the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC; \nPennebaker, 2001), use predefined dictionaries to categorize words. While highly interpretable, \ntransparent, and efficient at summarizing concepts, these methods often neglect context, leading to \npotential misinterpretations 25. LIWC may classify the word mad as an indicator of anger, yet in \nphrases like\n######################\nOutput:\n"

The colors \nrepresent different model types, indicating the proportion of participants for whom each \nmodel was the best predictor. \n 37Supplement \nSection 1: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) \nLatent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a probabilistic clustering algorithm that identifies \ntopics in a text corpus by modeling word co-occurrence patterns 31,32. Unlike predefined \ndictionaries, LDA infers topics directly from the data, allowing it to capture latent semantic \nstructures. Each word is assigned probabilistically to one or more topics, iterating until an \noptimal balance between word distributions is reached. This process generates posterior \nprobability distributions that estimate the likelihood of words appearing in specific topics, \nenabling LDA to account for contextual meanings and reduce word sense ambiguity. \nTo improve topic coherence and capture meaningful linguistic patterns, we applied LDA \nto one- to three-word phrases rather than individual words, ensuring that multi-word expressions \n(e.g., \"summer camp\" ) were treated as single units. We implemented LDA separately for \nnomothetic and idiographic analyses. The nomothetic model extracted a uniform set of topics \nacross all participants, while the idiographic model identified personalized topics for each \nindividual. \nFor topic extraction, we used the R package topicmodels  (Grün & Hornik, 2011) and \nperformed algorithmic tuning to determine the optimal number of topics ( k) using ldatuning . The \ntuning process involved evaluating multiple model fit metrics, including Griffiths2004 (Griffiths \net al., 2004), CaoJuan2009 (Cao et al., 2009), and Arun2010 (Arun et al., 2010). These metrics \nprovide different optimization criteria: Griffiths2004 favors maximizing coherence, whereas \nCaoJuan2009 and Arun2010 minimize redundancy and overfitting. Additionally, we considered \nthe Deveaud2014 reference point, which decreases linearly with the number of topics. Based on \nthese criteria, we selected six topics as an optimal balance, as illustrated in Fig. 1S. \n 38Section 2: Prompt GPT \n\"\"\" Evaluate the extent to which the participant experienced each of the following emotions: sadness, anger, \nnervousness, happiness, excitement, interest, boredom, general ratings of positive affect (pa), and general \nratings of negative affect (na) based on their responses to three questions. \n \nWhen evaluating emotions, consider the context of each question. For example, if a participant responds with \n\"none\" to the question about a stressful event, this may indicate lower negative\n######################\nOutput:\n"

For example, closed-vocabulary \nprograms (i.e., dictionary-based approach)1 such as the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC; \nPennebaker, 2001), use predefined dictionaries to categorize words. While highly interpretable, \ntransparent, and efficient at summarizing concepts, these methods often neglect context, leading to \npotential misinterpretations 25. LIWC may classify the word mad as an indicator of anger, yet in \nphrases like \"She’s mad talented\" , it conveys emphasis rather than negativity, illustrating how context-\ndependent meanings can lead to inaccurate classifications. In contrast, open-vocabulary approaches, \nsuch as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), and word embedding methods, leverage data-driven \ntechniques to examine a broader spectrum of words and topics 31–33. These methods are better at \ncapturing nuances, addressing ambiguous word meanings, and are less susceptible to \nmisinterpretations. Limitations of open-vocabulary approaches include the need for more technical \n \n1 We use the terms “closed-vocabulary” and “dictionary-based” interchangeably to refer to approaches that rely on \npredefined word categories (e.g., LIWC). These methods contrast with open-vocabulary approaches, which derive features \ndirectly from the text data without relying on preset dictionaries, often using machine learning or statistical models to \nidentify relevant patterns. \n 5expertise, larger datasets, and careful consideration of parameter choices, as well as challenges in \ninterpretability 25,29.  \nMore recently, LLMs like GPT have shown great promise in accurately identifying various \npsychological constructs in text, overcoming many of the constraints of older methods (Rathje et al., \n2024). These models can interpret the context of words and have achieved effective results across \nmultiple languages with simple prompts. The main limitations of this approach include a lack of \ntransparency in how inferences were generated and difficulties in reproducing results due to their \nprobabilistic nature 34. For example, although LLM-based approaches could predict whether a person \nexperiences negative emotions based on social media posts, LLMs could not be used to identify which \nlinguistic cues (such as the use of pronouns) predict this experience 19,27. In the latter case, dictionary-\nbased methods are preferrable. Ultimately, closed- and open-vocabulary approaches, along with \nadvancements in LLMs, provide complementary strengths that significantly enhance our ability to \nunderstand psychological states through language. By combining these methods, researchers may be \nable to leverage their unique advantages while mitigating their limitations, offering a robust alternative \nto traditional and relatively cumbersome self-report measures assessing emotions. \nDespite the increasing sophistication of these methods, significant gaps remain in the current \nliterature. Most importantly, existing studies on text-based emotion prediction have focused on \nexploring between-person differences, primarily identifying which text features are associated with \nindividuals experiencing high levels of negative emotions (e.g., Tackman et al., 2019). These \napproaches aggregate data across participants and aim to pinpoint common linguistic markers, such as \nthe use of first-person pronouns or negative sentiment, that are indicative of heightened emotional \ndistress and depression 36,37. However, this method overlooks both between-person differences in how \nlinguistic markers relate to emotions and within-person fluctuations in emotional states. Even when \nusing multilevel models to predict within-person fluctuations in emotions, models assumes that the \nsame linguistic features signal high levels of negative emotions across different individuals 37.  \n 6Such assumptions fail to account for the fact that language is inherently idiosyncratic, with \nindividuals expressing emotions in unique and context-dependent ways. Beck & Jackson, (2022) \ndemonstrated the importance of idiographic approaches by showing that the psychological and \nsituational antecedents that predicted future loneliness varied substantially across participants, with no \ntwo individuals showing the same pattern of predictive features. This highlights the need for \npersonalized models that adapt to the distinctive ways people express emotions through text, enabling \nmore accurate predictions tailored to each individual. To address this limitation, this study integrates \ndiverse language-based tools and leverages machine learning to develop personalized models capable \nof monitoring within-person fluctuations in emotional states.  \nThe study's primary goal is to examine whether within-person fluctuations in negative affect \n(NA) in adolescents' daily lives can be accurately tracked through text analysis. Since individuals \nexpress emotions in a variety of linguistic ways, this research aims to develop more personalized \napproaches to emotion tracking. \nSpecifically, we address two key questions: \n1) Do idiographic (individual-level) models outperform nomothetic (group-level) models in \npredicting emotion fluctuations? This question is motivated by the fact that individuals may \nexpress emotions through language in unique ways. \n2) Is combining various NLP approaches improves emotion prediction? \nWe compare three types of Natural Language Processing (NLP) approaches, which, as noted \nabove, have complementary strengths and limitations: \na) Closed vocabulary (dictionary-based approach: LIWC and VADER) \nb) Open vocabulary (LDA) \nc) GPT-derived ratings \nBy addressing these questions, the study aims to enhance the accuracy of emotion prediction \nmodels, potentially enabling closer monitoring of emotional fluctuations in daily life. The ultimate \n 7goal is to use these improved emotion predictions to inform the delivery of scalable, real-time, and \npersonalized interventions for alleviating high NA states and enhancing emotion regulation abilities in \nyouth. \nResults \nThe full results can be explored in the web app ( https://emotracknlp.streamlit.app/ ), which \nalso includes an interactive chatbot explaining the research, the figures and results presented in this \npaper, as well as additional findings.

These findings align with previous \n 12studies demonstrating the utility of NLP approaches in detecting emotional states across participants \n39,40. However, since these studies primarily focused on identifying emotional states at the between-\nperson level, rather than capturing within-person  fluctuations, their high performance does not \nnecessarily indicate an ability to accurately track moment-to-moment emotion fluctuation within \nindividuals. When we calculated performance metrics for each participant individually, the mean \nmodels' performance declined significantly and showed high between-person variability, indicating \nthat the nomothetic models' ability to track within-person changes varies considerably from one \nindividual to another. \nWhen we built separate models for each participant (idiographic models) and compared their \nperformance to that of nomothetic we found that the mean R2 was comparable between the two \napproaches, however, RMSE was lower for the idiographic models. In addition, idiographic models \nrevealed significant between-person variability in the text features predicting emotional states, \nindicating that individuals express negative emotions in distinct linguistic ways. This raises an \nintriguing question: if individuals differ so markedly in their predictive features, how can a nomothetic \nmodel that captures only general trends perform just as well? One plausible explanation is a trade-off \nbetween statistical power and individual variation. While idiographic models capture unique, person-\nspecific patterns, nomothetic models benefit from larger datasets that enable the estimation of multiple, \nweaker yet common feature-emotion relationships. In other words, although individual differences \nexist, the robust common patterns identified by the nomothetic approach appear sufficient to achieve \nsimilar predictive accuracy. Supporting this interpretation, idiographic models showed lower RMSE \nand higher accuracy for more participants compared to the nomothetic models. However, nomothetic \nmodels demonstrated greater consistency across participants, with more participants presenting \nsignificant associations between predicted and actual negative emotions compared to idiographic \nmodels.  \n 13Rather than directly comparing nomothetic and idiographic models, an alternative approach is to \nselect the best-performing model for each participant. Using this flexible approach, the vast majority \n(90.7–94.8%) of participants showed a significant correlation between predicted and observed emotion \nscores, highlighting the potential of personalized modeling strategies to improve prediction accuracy. \nWhile we are not aware of studies directly comparing nomothetic and idiographic approaches in \ntext analysis, previous research comparing their effectiveness in tracking mental states using passive \nsensor data from smartphones and actigraphy, as well as self-reported ecological momentary \nassessment (EMA), has yielded similar results (e.g., Aalbers et al., 2023; Cheung et al., 2017; Rozet et \nal., 2019; for exception see Soyster et al., 2022 who found that nomothetic models outperform \nidiographic models). For example, Aalbers et al., 2023 used smartphone passive sensor data to predict \nstress levels. Their findings revealed that idiographic models demonstrated higher accuracy in tracking \nstress levels for some participants (Spearman’s ρ rank-order correlation up to 1 in idiographic models \nvs. up to .65 in nomothetic models). However, nomothetic models significantly predicted stress for a \nlarger proportion of participants (up to 23.2% for idiographic models vs. up to 55% for nomothetic \nmodels). Rozet et al. (2019) used a comparable method and initially found that nomothetic models \nperformed better (i.e., were more accurate) than idiographic models. However, as more data \naccumulated, the performance of the idiographic model eventually equaled and then surpassed that of \nthe nomothetic model, suggesting that idiographic models may be a better option when sufficient data \nis available at the single subject level.   \nWhen comparing specific NLP approaches, GPT outperformed other models in its ability to track \nfluctuations in emotional states. It achieved R² values comparable to the model combining all three \nNLP approaches. Despite the relatively high R² values, GPT predictions also showed higher RMSE \nscores compared to the combined models, suggesting that while GPT may account for meaningful  \nvariance in emotional states, it may be less precise in predicting the exact numerical values of these \nstates. Furthermore, when selecting the best-performing model for each participant, GPT was chosen \n 14for only a relatively small portion of individuals, indicating that its predictions are  relatively stable \nacross individuals but not necessarily the most accurate for any single participant. This pattern aligns \nwith the nomothetic-idiographic trade-off discussed earlier, as GPT operates as a nomothetic model \nthat generalizes across individuals rather than incorporating person-specific information. Future \nresearch should aim to optimize this balance by leveraging fine-tuning techniques, such as participant-\nspecific calibration or supervised fine-tuning on emotion-labeled data,  to improve GPT model \naccuracy.  \nFrom an applied perspective, GPT is already trained on a vast corpus of data (approximately 45 \nterabytes of text data from various sources 45) which makes it particularly attractive for studies with \nlimited datasets, as it does not necessarily require retraining on task-specific data to yield meaningful \npredictions. However, the model's lack of transparency and inability to explicitly articulate the \nrationale behind its predictions remain critical limitations that researchers must carefully weigh 19. \nGiven these considerations, we recommend that researchers thoughtfully evaluate GPT's role in their \nanalytical pipeline, considering whether to employ it as a standalone tool or integrate it with \ncomplementary approaches. Future work should focus on developing methods that combine GPT's \npowerful inference capabilities with more transparent analytical approaches, potentially offering a \nmore robust framework for emotion analysis in psychological research. \nLimitation and future directions \nThis study is the first to use different\n######################\nOutput:\n"

GPT is built on a transformer-based architecture, a neural network design that excels at \n 20processing sequential data by using self-attention mechanisms to capture contextual relationships \nacross words. This allows GPT to generate human-like text by predicting the next word in a sequence \nbased on the provided context. Specifically, we used GPT-4, an advanced version pre-trained on a vast \ndataset (45TB), enabling it to generate coherent sentences and perform various tasks such as writing, \nanswering questions, and engaging in conversations. In this study, we prompted GPT-4 through the \napplication programming interface (API) using Python code to rate the extent to which a participant \nexperienced one of the following emotions: Sadness, Anger, and Nervousness, on a scale of 1 to 5 \n(similar to the scale used in EMA), based on responses to three open-text questions. See the \nsupplement for the full prompt used to generate GPT responses. \nData Analysis \nModel Specification   \nWe began our analysis by extracting text data from EMA responses and conducting both lexicon-\nbased and transformer-based analyses. Next, we applied preprocessing steps (e.g., text normalization, \nstopword removal, stemming) to refine the text before performing topic modeling. Finally, we trained \nmachine learning models to predict negative affect based on the derived text features, evaluated model \nperformance, and determined feature importance. Fig. 1 illustrates this analysis pipeline in detail. \nWe compared both nomothetic (group-level) and idiographic (individual-level) models in their \nability to predict variability in negative emotional states within individuals over time. We employed \ntwo machine learning approaches to predict negative affect: elastic net regression and random forest \nmodels. Elastic net regularization (ENR) is a popular variant of conventional regression that combines \ntwo types of penalties: ridge and lasso. This combination helps address issues related to \nmulticollinearity by constraining the coefficients of correlated variables while also minimizing model \noverfitting. On the other hand, random forest (RF) is an ensemble learning method based on decision \ntrees. Unlike ENR, random forest can capture complex nonlinear relationships and interactions \nbetween variables without having to specify them in advance. Given that these two methods rely on \n 21different algorithms (i.e., penalized regression- vs decision tree-based approaches) for selecting \nvariables, assessing their importance, and generating predictions, comparing them can help to \ndetermine which one provides the most accurate predictions in a given context. \nTo assess model performance and generalizability while minimizing overfitting, we implemented \na nested cross-validation (CV) procedure using the nestedcv package in R (Lewis et al., 2023). A full \ndescription of the nested CV procedure is provided in section S3 in the Supplement. We evaluated \nmodel accuracy using R² (the square of the correlation coefficient) and root mean squared error \n(RMSE). R² was our primary metric because we wanted to prioritize the model's ability to detect \nincreases in negative emotional states, reflected in corresponding increases in predicted scores. While a \nstronger correlation (and thus higher R²) indicates better alignment between predicted and observed \nvalues, it doesn't necessarily imply lower average prediction error, which is captured by the RMSE. \nInitially, we ran nomothetic models using features extracted from all three NLP approaches, \nincluding all subjects for group-level analysis. These models identified common predictors of negative \nemotional states at the group level. To evaluate how well these group-level models generalized to \nindividual participants, we calculated individual metrics, such as R², derived from the nomothetic \nmodels for each participant. Subsequently, we employed fully idiographic models, building separate \nmodels for each participant to capture person-specific language-emotion associations. These models \nfocused exclusively on within-person variability, aiming for highly individualized predictions. In these \nidiographic models, variables with low variance were removed based on standard frequency criteria, \nwhere the most common value for that variable could not exceed 95% of the total observations. \nFinally, we compared the three abovementioned approaches, to understand their relative strengths in \npredicting negative affect. \nFeature importance   \nTo evaluate feature importance, we used SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values, which \nquantify the contribution of each feature to the model's predictions in a consistent and interpretable \n 22manner by assessing how variations in a feature impact the model's output 50. SHAP values were \ncalculated using the R packages fastshap and ggbeeswarm , which facilitates visualization and \ninterpretation of feature contributions. This method allowed us to identify the relative importance of \npredictors in the model and their specific effects on the predicted outcomes.  \n \nReferences \n1. Barrett, L.

For example, if a participant responds with \\n\\\"none\\\" to the question about a stressful event, this may indicate lower negative emotions, whereas \\nresponding with \\\"none\\\" to a question about an enjoyable event may indicate lower positive emotions. \\n \\nProvide ratings on a scale of 1 to 5 for each emotion and for the general scales, along with a confidence level \\nfrom 0 to 100 for each rating. Ensure that the output includes the \\\"time\\\" variable from the input.

Outer loop: Evaluates the \\noverall performance of the model by repeatedly training and testing on different subsets of the \\ndata. 2. Inner loop: Conducts model selection and hyperparameter tuning to optimize \\nperformance. We used 10-fold cross-validation in both the inner and outer loops. In the outer \\nloop, the dataset was divided into ten folds. The model was trained on nine folds and tested on \\nthe remaining fold, with this process repeated ten times so that each fold served as the test set \\nonce. This iterative process ensures that performance metrics are evaluated across multiple train-\\ntest splits, providing a robust estimate of generalizability. Within the inner loop, models were \\ntrained on each training fold, and hyperparameter tuning was conducted by selecting the \\nparameter combination that maximized performance on a validation set. The best-performing \\nmodel was then applied to the corresponding outer loop test set. By separating hyperparameter \\noptimization from performance evaluation, this approach prevents data leakage and mitigates the \\nrisk of overfitting. Nested cross-validation offers several advantages over a simple train-test split. \\nIt allows for efficient use of all available data for both training and validation while reducing the \\nbias introduced by a single, potentially unrepresentative data split. Additionally, by incorporating \\nmultiple train-test iterations, this approach yields a more robust and reliable estimate of model \\nperformance, ensuring that the findings generalize beyond the specific dataset used in training. \\nAfter iterating through all outer folds, we aggregated the predictions from the left-out test sets \\nand compared them against true values to compute overall predictive performance.    \\n 40Section 4: Which Text Features Are Most Predictive in High- vs. Low-Performing Models? \\nThough feature importance varied across individuals, we also examined whether specific \\npatterns emerged across high- and low-performing participant-specific models. Our goal was to \\ndetermine if these patterns could reveal characteristics of participants for whom language is more \\nor less predictive of emotional states. Participants were divided into groups based on model \\nperformance (R2), with the top 25% (n=25) classified as \\\"High R2\\\" and the bottom 25% (n=25) \\nas \\\"Low R2.\\\" Feature importance scores were analyzed separately for RF and ENR models. \\nImportantly, participants with high- and low-performing models showed no significant \\ndifference in number of observations (RF: High mean =72.84, Low mean=60.64, t=1.69, p=0.09, \\nCI=-2.31;26.71, ENR: High mean =62.72, Low mean=71.36, t=-1.26, p=0.21, CI=-22.38;5.10) or in \\nmean negative affect (RF: High mean =0.68, Low mean=0.45, t=1.85, p=0.07, CI=-0.02;0.49, ENR: \\nHighmean =0.77, Low mean=0.65, t=0.72, p=0.47, CI=-0.20;0.43).

We encourage readers to explore the web app to engage more \ndeeply with the data and insights. \nDemographic and clinical characteristics \nTable 2 presents the demographic and clinical characteristics of the participants. For the \nparticipants who completed EMA in four consecutive weeks, the median number of EMA surveys \ncompleted was 77 (M = 75, SD = 24), and mean EMA compliance was 67% (SD = 21%).  For the \nparticipants who completed EMA in biweekly 5-day blocks, the median number of EMA surveys \ncompleted was 66 (M = 68, SD = 24), and mean EMA compliance was 51% (SD = 17%).  \nModel performance: Nomothetic Approach \nTable 3 presents model performance metrics for predicting negative affect using combined text \nfeatures from three NLP techniques. Three modeling approaches are compared: group-level \nnomothetic (one model combining all observations), per-participant nomothetic (performance \ncalculated separately), and idiographic (separate models for each individual). Further details and \nresults, including separate models for each NLP technique, are available in the Web app (see \"Model \nperformance across sample” and “Model performance per participant”). \nThe group-level nomothetic model performed well, with R² values ranging from 0.11 to 0.38. \nHowever, when evaluated separately for each participant, which is critical given the ultimate goal of \ntracking fluctuations in emotions within individuals, performance decreased substantially. Mean R² \nvalues fell between 0.06 and 0.11, with considerable variability in predictive accuracy across \n 8participants. For example, when predicting mean negative affect, individual R² values ranged from \n0.00 to 0.41, demonstrating that while text features explained little to no variability in negative affect \nfor some, they accounted for a significant proportion of variability in others. See Table 3 for results for \nthe specific emotions of sadness, anger, and nervousness. \nModel performance: Idiographic Approach \nThe idiographic approach (separate models for each individual) showed similar average \nperformance to the nomothetic approach, with mean R² values ranging from 0.06 to 0.10. However, the \nidiographic approach demonstrated better performance in terms of RMSE (0.47 to 0.76) compared to \nthe nomothetic model (0.52 to 0.88), suggesting lower prediction error. In addition, for negative affect, \nthe idiographic approach showed greater variability in R² across participants, achieving higher \naccuracy for some individuals. However, the nomothetic approach identified significant associations in \na larger proportion of participants (55–58% vs. 43–48%). A similar pattern emerged for sadness, \nsuggesting that while person-specific models can improve accuracy for certain individuals, the \nnomothetic approach is more robust for detecting significant associations across a broader sample. Fig. \n2 displays the relationship between predicted and observed (actual) negative affect ratings using \nperson-specific (idiographic) models. Each colored line represents an individual participant’s predicted \nestimates (y axis) across different levels of actual negative affect (x axis). While the overall trend, \nrepresented by the dashed black line, suggests a generally positive relationship between predicted and \nactual ratings, indicating that the models capture meaningful within-person fluctuations in negative \naffect, this should not be taken to imply consistent accuracy at the individual level. The notable \nbetween-person differences in model fit underscore that good overall performance does not guarantee \nreliable prediction for every participant. \nFig. 3 displays the substantial differences in model accuracy across individuals by showcasing \nexamples of four high- vs low-accuracy person-specific models (figures for all other outcomes and for \n 9all participants for both the nomothetic and idiographic models are available on the Web app “True vs. \nPredicted”). \nExamining Between-Person Differences in Which Text Features Predict Negative Affect \nFig. 4 illustrates the variability in feature importance by showing the top 10 text features from \nthe four best-performing subject-specific random forest models predicting negative affect. These \nmodels are the same four high-accuracy models displayed in Fig. 3. The results show two types of \nvariability between individuals: differences in model performance and, even among highly accurate \nmodels, differences in the text features that contribute to predicting negative affect. Critically, this \nvisualization demonstrates how text features provide valuable contextual information. For example, \none participant (K23541) exhibits more negative emotions when using words related to their family \n(\"Family\"), yet another (KTGF533) shows greater negative emotions when focusing on the past \n(\"FocusPast\"). Similarly, a different participant (KTGF528) expresses more negative emotions when \nwriting about work-related topics (\"Work\") but demonstrates less negativity when using words \nassociated with acquiring objects, states, or goals that fulfill personal needs (\"Acquire\"). This rich \ninformation can be used to create person-specific profiles that enable us to identify the specific \ncontexts in which negative emotions arise, providing insights that can be used to personalize \ninterventions. A heatmap of the feature importance across participants and feature importance figures \nfor each participant, outcome, and ML model are available on the Web app (\"Feature importance \nheatmap\" and \"Feature importance per participant\").

At the baseline session, either in-person or over \\nZoom, participants were administered a semi-structured clinical interview, the Kiddie Schedule for \\nAffective Disorders and Schizophrenia (K-SADS; Kaufman et al., 1997), and completed self-report \\nmeasures. Following the baseline session, participants installed the MetricWire app on their \\nsmartphones to complete ecological momentary assessments (EMAs). Of the participants, 39 \\ncompleted the EMA for four consecutive weeks; for the first 5 days, surveys were delivered 2-3 times \\nper day in the afternoon and evening, and for the remaining 25 days, surveys were delivered 4 times \\nper day. The other 58 participants completed the EMA in 5-day (Thursday through Monday) blocks \\nevery other week, with 2-3 survey prompts per day, for a median of 17 weeks.  \\n 18Measures \\nEcological Momentary Assessment (EMA)  \\nParticipants were asked to rate on a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from 0, “Very slightly or not at \\nall,” to 4, “Extremely” the extent to which they were feeling several emotions immediately before they \\nstarted the assessment. Participants’ negative affect (NA) included responses for: “sad,” “nervous,” \\nand “angry.” Mean NA was measured by averaging the three NA variables. In addition, participants \\nresponded to the following open-ended questions: 1) What were you thinking about right before you \\nstarted this survey? 2) Think about the most enjoyable or happy time since you completed the last \\nsurvey (or if this is your first survey, then the last 24 hours). Very briefly, what happened (1-2 \\nsentences is fine)? 3) Think about the most stressful or negative time since you completed the last \\nsurvey (or if this is your first survey, then the last 24 hours). Very briefly, what happened (1-2 \\nsentences is fine)? Participants with fewer than 30 observations were excluded from the analysis.  \\nLanguage Measures  \\nWe used the following strategies to extract text features and generate quantitative summaries of \\nthe language data. \\nClose vocabulary.  For close vocabulary (dictionary-based approach), we extracted features \\nusing the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC; Tausczik & Pennebaker, 2010) and the Valence \\nAware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner (VADER; Hutto & Gilbert, 2014). LIWC is a computerized \\ntext analysis tool that categorizes words into over 90 linguistic and psychological dimensions based on \\nan internal dictionary of approximately 6,400 words 48. It calculates the percentage of words that match \\neach predefined category, offering insights into linguistic structures (e.g., pronouns), psychological \\nconstructs (e.g., affect), and broader language patterns (e.g., analytical thinking). The LIWC has been \\nextensively validated across numerous studies and is widely used in psychological research to quantify \\nlanguage use patterns associated with various psychological states and traits. For this study, we used \\n 19LIWC-22 23, the latest version of the software, the analyze participants' responses to the EMA open \\nquestions. \\nVADER is a simple rule-based model for general sentiment analysis optimized for social media. \\nIt provides four sentiment scores: negative, positive, neutral, and compound (an overall sentiment \\nscore from -1 to +1). VADER is particularly effective at handling sentiments expressed in short, \\ninformal text and accounts for factors like punctuation, capitalization, and modifiers (e.g., intensifiers \\nlike \\\"very\\\") that influence the intensity of the sentiment. Whereas LIWC excels in offering detailed \\npsychological and linguistic insights across a wide range of texts, VADER is more attuned to detecting \\nsentiment polarity and intensity in social media. Finally, text lengths were extracted as features for \\neach question and included in the models. \\nOpen vocabulary.  Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a probabilistic clustering method that \\nidentifies topics based on word co-occurrence rather than relying on predefined dictionaries 31,32. This \\napproach allows LDA to group semantically related words while considering context, reducing word \\nsense ambiguity. The latent topics were extracted from the preprocessed text corpus using probabilistic \\nmodeling with the R package topicmodels  49. In our study, we implemented LDA using two distinct \\napproaches for nomothetic and idiographic analyses. For the nomothetic model, we extracted a \\nuniform set of topics across the entire sample. For the idiographic model, we applied LDA separately \\nfor each individual, identifying topics based on their unique word usage patterns. To interpret the \\nextracted nomothetic  topics, Table 1 presents the 15 most frequent words per topic, offering a \\nsemantic representation of the clustering. Furthermore, Fig. S2 depicts the distribution of LDA-derived \\ntopics across participants, highlighting variations in topic prevalence within the dataset. Details on \\ntopic selection, model tuning, and evaluation metrics are provided in the Supplement.  \\nGenerative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT).  To generate emotion ratings using large \\nlanguage models (LLMs), we used GPT, a deep learning-based AI language model developed by \\nOpenAI. GPT is built on a transformer-based architecture, a neural network design that excels at \\n 20processing sequential data by using self-attention mechanisms to capture contextual relationships \\nacross words. This allows GPT to generate human-like text by predicting the next word in a sequence \\nbased on the provided context. Specifically, we used GPT-4, an advanced version pre-trained on a vast \\ndataset (45TB), enabling it to generate coherent sentences and perform various tasks such\\n######################\\nOutput:\\n\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"MetricWire\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"MetricWire is an application installed by participants for ecological momentary assessments, collecting data from users on their emotional states.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (K-SADS)\\\"<|>\\\"event\\\"<|>\\\"The K-SADS is a semi-structured clinical interview used to assess participants for mood and affective disorders as part of the study protocol.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA)\\\"<|>\\\"event\\\"<|>\\\"EMA is a data collection method used in the study where participants report their emotional states at various times over a defined period.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Participants\\\"<|>\\\"person\\\"<|>\\\"Participants are individuals involved in the study who provide data through interviews and self-reports on emotional affect and experiences.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC)\\\"<|>\\\"technology\\\"<|>\\\"LIWC is a computerized text analysis tool utilized to quantify language use patterns in psychological research through predefined linguistic and psychological categories.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner (VADER)\\\"<|>\\\"technology\\\"<|>\\\"VADER is a sentiment analysis tool designed for social media text, providing four sentiment scores and focusing on polarity and intensity.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT)\\\"<|>\\\"technology\\\"<|>\\\"GPT is a language model developed by OpenAI that utilizes transformer architecture for generating human-like text and processing emotional ratings in the study.\\\")##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Participants\\\"<|>\\\"Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (K-SADS)\\\"<|>\\\"Participants undergo the K-SADS as part of the assessment to identify affective disorders, making their experiences central to the clinical evaluation.\\\"<|>\\\"assessment, clinical evaluation\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Participants\\\"<|>\\\"Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA)\\\"<|>\\\"Participants engage in the EMA method, providing real-time data about their emotional states during the study period.\\\"<|>\\\"data collection, emotional assessment\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Participants\\\"<|>\\\"MetricWire\\\"<|>\\\"Participants utilize the MetricWire app to facilitate their completion of EMAs, linking technology to the assessment process.\\\"<|>\\\"technology use, data collection\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC)\\\"<|>\\\"Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT)\\\"<|>\\\"LIWC and GPT are both tools applied in the study to analyze language data, showcasing different methodologies for understanding text features.\\\"<|>\\\"data analysis, text processing\\\"<|>7)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner (VADER)\\\"<|>\\\"Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT)\\\"<|>\\\"Both VADER and GPT are technologies used in the study to assess sentiment and emotional responses, although through different approaches.\\\"<|>\\\"sentiment analysis, emotion processing\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"content_keywords\\\"<|>\\\"data collection, emotional assessment, technology, language analysis\\\")<|COMPLETE|>\"}]\nMANY entities were missed in the last extraction.

This rich \\ninformation can be used to create person-specific profiles that enable us to identify the specific \\ncontexts in which negative emotions arise, providing insights that can be used to personalize \\ninterventions. A heatmap of the feature importance across participants and feature importance figures \\nfor each participant, outcome, and ML model are available on the Web app (\\\"Feature importance \\nheatmap\\\" and \\\"Feature importance per participant\\\"). Details on the differences in predictive text \\nfeatures between high- and low-performing models can be found in the Supplement ( Section S4  and \\nFig. S3). \\nDo Closed Vocabulary, Open Vocabulary, LLM, or Combined Approaches Perform Best in \\nPredicting Negative Emotions? \\nFig. 6 displays the performance metrics for each NLP approach used in the idiographic models. \\nWhen examining the idiographic predictive performance of each NLP approach separately, GPT \\n 10generally showed better performance for negative affect, sadness, anger, and nervousness, with R² \\nvalues around 0.10 for negative affect and sadness, and slightly lower for anger and nervousness. \\nThese results were comparable to those achieved by the idiographic models that combined all NLP \\napproaches (see Table 3 for the combined model results), except in the prediction of nervousness \\nwhere GPT slightly outperformed the combined idiographic model. However, it is important to note \\nthat while GPT had relatively strong R² values, it also had a higher RMSE compared to the \\ncombined models, suggesting a higher average prediction error despite accounting for more \\nvariance in the outcomes. LIWC+VADER and LDA each demonstrated poorer predictive \\nperformance, with the lowest average R² values and fewer significant associations across all \\nemotions, especially for anger and nervousness. This highlights that the contextual understanding \\nprovided by GPT was more effective in capturing within-person emotional fluctuations compared to \\nthe other methods when NLP approaches were tested individually. Overall, while GPT captures \\nvariability in negative affect (as reflected by R²), its predictions are less precise in terms of exact \\nvalues (as indicated by RMSE). Combined models, which balance capturing variability and \\nminimizing prediction errors, offer a more robust and reliable approach to emotion prediction. \\nEvaluating Best Performing Models for Each Individual \\n          To investigate the effectiveness of personalized models, we identified the best-performing \\npredictive model for each of the 97 participants. Using this flexible approach, the vast majority (90.7-\\n94.8%) of the participants showed a significant correlation between predicted and observed (actual) \\nemotion scores. The table detailing the best model for each participant and each emotion outcome can \\nbe found in the Web app under \\\"Best model performance\\\". Fig. S4 shows the distribution of best-\\nperforming models across participants. Idiographic models were most frequently selected for all \\noutcomes except for Anger, where nomothetic models performed best for 44.3% of the participants. \\nElastic Net showed the best performance for most participants across outcomes, followed by Random \\nForest. For NLP approaches, the model combining all text features outperformed for most of the \\n 11participants (52.6-59.8%). Interestingly, though GPT showed the highest mean R² scores, it was \\nchosen as the best model for only a relatively small portion of the participants (11.3-19.6%). \\nAre Models Emotion-Specific? \\nTo examine whether our models captured emotion-specific signals rather than general negative \\naffect, we compared the extent to which each emotion-specific model (both Random Forest and Elastic \\nNet) predicted each observed emotion. Specifically, for each observed emotion outcome (NA, Sad, \\nAngry, and Nervous), we calculated R² and RMSE between the observed and the predicted emotion, \\neither matching (e.g., observed and predicted sadness) or mismatching (e.g., observed sadness and \\npredicted anger). As shown in Fig. S4-S7 (see also in the web app under “Best Model Performance”), \\nwhich display box plots of the distribution of R² and RMSE for each emotion, overall, and consistent \\nwith the interpretation that the models have emotion-specific signals, the matched predictions showed \\nhigher R² and lower RMSE than mismatched predictions, indicating that the models capture unique, \\nemotion-specific variance. However, for RMSE, we sometimes observed better performance for NA \\nrelative to the specific emotions, suggesting that the signals underlying broad negative affect might be \\nmore robust or reliable relative to single emotion ratings. \\nDiscussion  \\nIn this study, we combined multiple Natural Language Processing (NLP) approaches to examine \\nwhether within-person fluctuations in emotion can be accurately tracked through text analysis. \\nRecognizing the idiosyncratic nature of emotional communication, we compared idiographic models, \\ntailored to individual patterns, with nomothetic models that capture common trends across groups.  The \\nleveraging of advanced NLP and machine learning techniques to track moment-to-moment emotional \\nchanges through text analysis has the potential to enhance mental health monitoring, support clinical \\ndecision-making, and enable early detection of distress for timely, personalized interventions. \\nThe results showed that, overall, group-level nomothetic models showed high performance in \\ncontinuously predicting negative emotions (R2 range: 0.11-0.38).

For example, closed-vocabulary \\nprograms (i.e., dictionary-based approach)1 such as the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC; \\nPennebaker, 2001), use predefined dictionaries to categorize words. While highly interpretable, \\ntransparent, and efficient at summarizing concepts, these methods often neglect context, leading to \\npotential misinterpretations 25. LIWC may classify the word mad as an indicator of anger, yet in \\nphrases like \\\"She’s mad talented\\\" , it conveys emphasis rather than negativity, illustrating how context-\\ndependent meanings can lead to inaccurate classifications. In contrast, open-vocabulary approaches, \\nsuch as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), and word embedding methods, leverage data-driven \\ntechniques to examine a broader spectrum of words and topics 31–33. These methods are better at \\ncapturing nuances, addressing ambiguous word meanings, and are less susceptible to \\nmisinterpretations. Limitations of open-vocabulary approaches include the need for more technical \\n \\n1 We use the terms “closed-vocabulary” and “dictionary-based” interchangeably to refer to approaches that rely on \\npredefined word categories (e.g., LIWC). These methods contrast with open-vocabulary approaches, which derive features \\ndirectly from the text data without relying on preset dictionaries, often using machine learning or statistical models to \\nidentify relevant patterns. \\n 5expertise, larger datasets, and careful consideration of parameter choices, as well as challenges in \\ninterpretability 25,29.  \\nMore recently, LLMs like GPT have shown great promise in accurately identifying various \\npsychological constructs in text, overcoming many of the constraints of older methods (Rathje et al., \\n2024). These models can interpret the context of words and have achieved effective results across \\nmultiple languages with simple prompts. The main limitations of this approach include a lack of \\ntransparency in how inferences were generated and difficulties in reproducing results due to their \\nprobabilistic nature 34. For example, although LLM-based approaches could predict whether a person \\nexperiences negative emotions based on social media posts, LLMs could not be used to identify which \\nlinguistic cues (such as the use of pronouns) predict this experience 19,27. In the latter case, dictionary-\\nbased methods are preferrable. Ultimately, closed- and open-vocabulary approaches, along with \\nadvancements in LLMs, provide complementary strengths that significantly enhance our ability to \\nunderstand psychological states through language. By combining these methods, researchers may be \\nable to leverage their unique advantages while mitigating their limitations, offering a robust alternative \\nto traditional and relatively cumbersome self-report measures assessing emotions. \\nDespite the increasing sophistication of these methods, significant gaps remain in the current \\nliterature. Most importantly, existing studies on text-based emotion prediction have focused on \\nexploring between-person differences, primarily identifying which text features are associated with \\nindividuals experiencing high levels of negative emotions (e.g., Tackman et al., 2019). These \\napproaches aggregate data across participants and aim to pinpoint common linguistic markers, such as \\nthe use of first-person pronouns or negative sentiment, that are indicative of heightened emotional \\ndistress and depression 36,37. However, this method overlooks both between-person differences in how \\nlinguistic markers relate to emotions and within-person fluctuations in emotional states. Even when \\nusing multilevel models to predict within-person fluctuations in emotions, models assumes that the \\nsame linguistic features signal high levels of negative emotions across different individuals 37.  \\n 6Such assumptions fail to account for the fact that language is inherently idiosyncratic, with \\nindividuals expressing emotions in unique and context-dependent ways. Beck & Jackson, (2022) \\ndemonstrated the importance of idiographic approaches by showing that the psychological and \\nsituational antecedents that predicted future loneliness varied substantially across participants, with no \\ntwo individuals showing the same pattern of predictive features. This highlights the need for \\npersonalized models that adapt to the distinctive ways people express emotions through text, enabling \\nmore accurate predictions tailored to each individual. To address this limitation, this study integrates \\ndiverse language-based tools and leverages machine learning to develop personalized models capable \\nof monitoring within-person fluctuations in emotional states.  \\nThe study's primary goal is to examine whether within-person fluctuations in negative affect \\n(NA) in adolescents' daily lives can be accurately tracked through text analysis. Since individuals \\nexpress emotions in a variety of linguistic ways, this research aims to develop more personalized \\napproaches to emotion tracking. \\nSpecifically, we address two key questions: \\n1) Do idiographic (individual-level) models outperform nomothetic (group-level) models in \\npredicting emotion fluctuations? This question is motivated by the fact that individuals may \\nexpress emotions through language in unique ways. \\n2) Is combining various NLP approaches improves emotion prediction? \\nWe compare three types of Natural Language Processing (NLP) approaches, which, as noted \\nabove, have complementary strengths and limitations: \\na) Closed vocabulary (dictionary-based approach: LIWC and VADER) \\nb) Open vocabulary (LDA) \\nc) GPT-derived ratings \\nBy addressing these questions, the study aims to enhance the accuracy of emotion prediction \\nmodels, potentially enabling closer monitoring of emotional fluctuations in daily life. The ultimate \\n 7goal is to use these improved emotion predictions to inform the delivery of scalable, real-time, and \\npersonalized interventions for alleviating high NA states and enhancing emotion regulation abilities in \\nyouth. \\nResults \\nThe full results can be explored in the web app ( https://emotracknlp.streamlit.app/ ), which \\nalso includes an interactive chatbot explaining the research, the figures and results presented in this \\npaper, as well as additional findings.

Future work should focus on developing methods that combine GPT's \\npowerful inference capabilities with more transparent analytical approaches, potentially offering a \\nmore robust framework for emotion analysis in psychological research. \\nLimitation and future directions \\nThis study is the first to use different NLP approaches to directly compare nomothetic and \\nidiographic models for tracking emotional fluctuations. Yet, findings of this study should be \\ninterpreted in light of several limitations. First, capturing the nuanced dynamics of emotional \\nexpression typically requires large amounts of data. In everyday interactions, subtle emotional changes \\nmay only become apparent with extensive exposure to an individual’s language use, much like \\nknowing someone well enables you to discern small shifts in their mood. Therefore, future studies \\n 15should strive to collect larger within-person datasets, potentially sourced from daily-life \\ncommunications, to enhance the ability to track and model these nuances. \\nSecond, the overall predictive accuracy was modest, leaving significant room for improvement. \\nIn addition to increasing the quantity of data, future research could benefit from incorporating \\nadditional modalities (e.g., vocal features, facial expression, passive sensors from smartphones or \\nwearables such as smartwatches or smart ring, which are becoming increasingly popular) alongside \\ntext. Prior studies have shown that combining various modalities can enhance the performance of \\nnomothetic models of emotion (see Gandhi et al., 2023 for a review), this multimodal approach may \\nalso improve idiographic models. Moreover, future work should explore whether individuals not only \\ndiffer in the text features that predict their emotions but also in the types of modalities that best capture \\ntheir emotional states.  For example, individual differences, such as tendency to use affective \\nsuppression, may influence how emotions are conveyed in text, with greater suppression potentially \\nleading to lower model performance. Future studies should examine whether these participants require \\nlarger datasets to capture subtle nuances in their text, or if alternative modalities (e.g., passive sensor) \\nbetter detect changes in their emotional states. \\nThird, the current study compared idiographic and nomothetic approaches, demonstrating that \\neach has its merits. Future studies could explore hybrid approaches that integrate both individual-\\nspecific and group-level information, balancing personalization with statistical power to enhance \\npredictive accuracy. Finally, the text data in our study consisted of responses to specific questions, \\nwhich may limit the generalizability of our findings to other types of text (e.g., text messages and \\nsocial media posts). Future research should incorporate text from diverse sources such as social media, \\nconversational exchanges, and free-form writing, to determine whether these results extend to broader \\ncontexts.  \\n 16Conclusion \\nIn conclusion, our findings highlight the potential of combining NLP approaches to track within-\\nperson emotional fluctuations, demonstrating both the strengths and limitations of idiographic and \\nnomothetic models. Nomothetic models effectively capture general trends, making them useful for \\nbroad applications. In contrast, idiographic models provide a more nuanced understanding by \\nidentifying person-specific features that reflect an individual's unique emotional expression, though \\nthey require large within-person datasets to model these patterns reliably. Rather than a one-size-fits-\\nall approach, our results suggest that selecting the best approach for each participant can enhance \\npredictive accuracy. Expanding this work to incorporate diverse text sources and multimodal data \\nstreams (e.g., integrating social media posts, speech transcripts, facial expressions, physiological \\nsignals, or smartphone sensor data) may further advance the field. \\nUltimately, improving the ability to monitor emotions in real-time not only enhances our ability \\nto study emotional phenomena as they unfold in daily life but also can help inform the development \\nand deployment of just-in-time (JIT) interventions that go beyond identifying moments of distress to \\nalso consider the specific emotions and contextual factors in which they arise, enabling more \\npersonalized and effective interventions for youth. \\n 17Method \\nParticipants \\nParticipants were derived from two larger studies that recruited adolescents with elevated levels \\nof anhedonia, as well as typically developing (non-anhedonic) adolescents.

These findings align with previous \\n 12studies demonstrating the utility of NLP approaches in detecting emotional states across participants \\n39,40. However, since these studies primarily focused on identifying emotional states at the between-\\nperson level, rather than capturing within-person  fluctuations, their high performance does not \\nnecessarily indicate an ability to accurately track moment-to-moment emotion fluctuation within \\nindividuals. When we calculated performance metrics for each participant individually, the mean \\nmodels' performance declined significantly and showed high between-person variability, indicating \\nthat the nomothetic models' ability to track within-person changes varies considerably from one \\nindividual to another. \\nWhen we built separate models for each participant (idiographic models) and compared their \\nperformance to that of nomothetic we found that the mean R2 was comparable between the two \\napproaches, however, RMSE was lower for the idiographic models. In addition, idiographic models \\nrevealed significant between-person variability in the text features predicting emotional states, \\nindicating that individuals express negative emotions in distinct linguistic ways. This raises an \\nintriguing question: if individuals differ so markedly in their predictive features, how can a nomothetic \\nmodel that captures only general trends perform just as well? One plausible explanation is a trade-off \\nbetween statistical power and individual variation. While idiographic models capture unique, person-\\nspecific patterns, nomothetic models benefit from larger datasets that enable the estimation of multiple, \\nweaker yet common feature-emotion relationships. In other words, although individual differences \\nexist, the robust common patterns identified by the nomothetic approach appear sufficient to achieve \\nsimilar predictive accuracy. Supporting this interpretation, idiographic models showed lower RMSE \\nand higher accuracy for more participants compared to the nomothetic models. However, nomothetic \\nmodels demonstrated greater consistency across participants, with more participants presenting \\nsignificant associations between predicted and actual negative emotions compared to idiographic \\nmodels.  \\n 13Rather than directly comparing nomothetic and idiographic models, an alternative approach is to \\nselect the best-performing model for each participant. Using this flexible approach, the vast majority \\n(90.7–94.8%) of participants showed a significant correlation between predicted and observed emotion \\nscores, highlighting the potential of personalized modeling strategies to improve prediction accuracy. \\nWhile we are not aware of studies directly comparing nomothetic and idiographic approaches in \\ntext analysis, previous research comparing their effectiveness in tracking mental states using passive \\nsensor data from smartphones and actigraphy, as well as self-reported ecological momentary \\nassessment (EMA), has yielded similar results (e.g., Aalbers et al., 2023; Cheung et al., 2017; Rozet et \\nal., 2019; for exception see Soyster et al., 2022 who found that nomothetic models outperform \\nidiographic models). For example, Aalbers et al., 2023 used smartphone passive sensor data to predict \\nstress levels. Their findings revealed that idiographic models demonstrated higher accuracy in tracking \\nstress levels for some participants (Spearman’s ρ rank-order correlation up to 1 in idiographic models \\nvs. up to .65 in nomothetic models). However, nomothetic models significantly predicted stress for a \\nlarger proportion of participants (up to 23.2% for idiographic models vs. up to 55% for nomothetic \\nmodels). Rozet et al. (2019) used a comparable method and initially found that nomothetic models \\nperformed better (i.e., were more accurate) than idiographic models. However, as more data \\naccumulated, the performance of the idiographic model eventually equaled and then surpassed that of \\nthe nomothetic model, suggesting that idiographic models may be a better option when sufficient data \\nis available at the single subject level.   \\nWhen comparing specific NLP approaches, GPT outperformed other models in its ability to track \\nfluctuations in emotional states. It achieved R² values comparable to the model combining all three \\nNLP approaches. Despite the relatively high R² values, GPT predictions also showed higher RMSE \\nscores compared to the combined models, suggesting that while GPT may account for meaningful  \\nvariance in emotional states, it may be less precise in predicting the exact numerical values of these \\nstates. Furthermore, when selecting the best-performing model for each participant, GPT was chosen \\n 14for only a relatively small portion of individuals, indicating that its predictions are  relatively stable \\nacross individuals but not necessarily the most accurate for any single participant. This pattern aligns \\nwith the nomothetic-idiographic trade-off discussed earlier, as GPT operates as a nomothetic model \\nthat generalizes across individuals rather than incorporating person-specific information. Future \\nresearch should aim to optimize this balance by leveraging fine-tuning techniques, such as participant-\\nspecific calibration or supervised fine-tuning on emotion-labeled data,  to improve GPT model \\naccuracy.  \\nFrom an applied perspective, GPT is already trained on a vast corpus of data (approximately 45 \\nterabytes of text data from various sources 45) which makes it particularly attractive for studies with \\nlimited datasets, as it does not necessarily require retraining on task-specific data to yield meaningful \\npredictions. However, the model's lack of transparency and inability to explicitly articulate the \\nrationale behind its predictions remain critical limitations that researchers must carefully weigh 19. \\nGiven these considerations, we recommend that researchers thoughtfully evaluate GPT's role in their \\nanalytical pipeline, considering whether to employ it as a standalone tool or integrate it with \\ncomplementary approaches. Future work should focus on developing methods that combine GPT's \\npowerful inference capabilities with more transparent analytical approaches, potentially offering a \\nmore robust framework for emotion analysis in psychological research. \\nLimitation and future directions \\nThis study is the first to use different\\n######################\\nOutput:\\n\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"GPT\\\"<|>\\\"technology\\\"<|>\\\"GPT is an advanced language model trained on a vast corpus of text data, capable of predicting and tracking fluctuations in emotional states through NLP techniques.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"idiographic models\\\"<|>\\\"concept\\\"<|>\\\"Idiographic models are personalized approaches that capture unique, individual-specific patterns in data, showing more accuracy for some participants in predicting emotional states.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"nomothetic models\\\"<|>\\\"concept\\\"<|>\\\"Nomothetic models generalize across individuals, capturing common patterns and trends, but may not fully account for individual variations in emotional expression.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Aalbers et al.

To uncover the utility of text-based approaches for \\nemotion prediction, this study compares nomothetic and idiographic modeling approaches for \\npredicting adolescents’ daily negative affect (NA) using text features. It also evaluates different \\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) techniques in capturing within-person emotion fluctuations. We \\nanalyzed ecological momentary assessment (EMA) text responses from 98 adolescents (ages 14-18, \\n77.3 % female, 22.7% male, N EMA=7,680). Text features were extracted using dictionary-based \\napproach, topic modeling, and GPT-derived emotion ratings. Random Forest and Elastic Net \\nRegression models predicted NA from these text features, comparing nomothetic (group-level) and \\nidiographic (individualized) approaches. All key findings, interactive visualizations, and model \\ncomparisons are available via the website: https://emotracknlp.streamlit.app/ . Idiographic models \\ncombining text features from different NLP approaches showed the best performance: they performed \\ncomparably to nomothetic models in R² but yielded lower prediction error (Root Mean Squared Error), \\nimproving within-person precision. Importantly, there was substantial between-person differences in \\nmodel performance and predictive linguistic features. When selecting the best-performing model for \\neach participant, significant correlations between predicted and observed emotion scores were found \\nfor 90.7–94.8% of participants. Our findings suggest that while nomothetic models offer initial \\nscalability, idiographic models may provide greater predictive precision with sufficient within-person \\ndata. A flexible, personalized approach that selects the optimal model for each individual may enhance \\nemotion monitoring, while leveraging text data to provide contextual insights. \\n \\nEmotions play a fundamental role in human life, serving as essential cues that influence our \\nactions and interactions with the environment 1. Emotional states act as immediate alerts to potential \\nbenefits or dangers, driving us towards actions that align with our personal goals and away from Commented [HF1]: The first part (excluding the method) \\nup to 5000 words. No title to the introduction.  \\n 3potential threats 2. Research shows that not only the intensity of emotions but also their temporal \\ndynamics can contribute to the development of mood disorders 3–7. This is especially important for \\nadolescents, a developmental period marked by increases in the frequency of negative emotional states, \\nwhich may contribute to their elevated risk for depression 8–10. Developing effective methods to \\nmeasure daily emotional changes that are specifically suitable for adolescents is crucial. These \\nmeasurements could identify both acute emotional distress and longer-term maladaptive patterns in \\nemotions, serving two key purposes: enabling timely interventions during periods of high negative \\naffect and facilitating targeted intervention to address maladaptive emotional patterns. Such methods \\ncould help predict increased risk of affective disorder onset (such as depression), which could inform \\nthe timely and targeted delivery of preventative interventions, ultimately contributing to improved \\nmental health outcomes.  \\nLanguage offers a promising avenue for measuring emotion, as people convey their emotional \\nstates both explicitly and implicitly through their choice of words and their manner of speaking or \\nwriting 11,12. Language plays a dual role in the realm of emotions, serving not only as a primary tool for \\nexpressing and communicating emotional states but also as an actively shaping how emotions are \\nexperienced 13,14. Therefore, the current study aims to explore whether text can be used to track within-\\nperson fluctuation in emotional states. \\nWith the rise of digital communication, people, especially adolescents, now express themselves \\nextensively through text-based interactions, including social media posts, messages, and online \\ndiscussions. This shift has generated an unprecedented volume of language data, offering a unique \\nopportunity to study adolescent emotions on a larger scale 15,16. Advances in natural language \\nprocessing (NLP), a multidisciplinary field combining computer science, artificial intelligence, and \\nlinguistics, have enabled researchers to analyze this data efficiently and meaningfully 17,18. While NLP \\nhas been used in behavioral science for decades, its accessibility and affordability have significantly \\n 4improved, making it an increasingly popular tool 19. One key advantage of NLP over traditional, \\nmanual text analysis is its ability to handle large datasets—such as thousands of social media posts or \\ndigitized texts—quickly and efficiently. By leveraging these advancements, NLP methods can identify \\npatterns in language use (e.g., sentiment, tone, and self-referential quality), offering real-time insights \\ninto emotional states without requiring participants to actively report their feelings 20–22. Importantly, \\ntext-based communication provides insights not only into the intensity of emotions but also into the \\ncontext in which those emotions arise. This contextual information can reveal situational factors \\ncontributing to emotional experiences, offering a more nuanced understanding of emotional processes.  \\nIn recent years, various text analysis tools have emerged 23–29, ranging from basic approaches \\nlike counting word frequencies to more advanced methods, such as leveraging large language models \\n(LLMs), each with its own set of advantages and limitations. For example, closed-vocabulary \\nprograms (i.e., dictionary-based approach)1 such as the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC; \\nPennebaker, 2001), use predefined dictionaries to categorize words. While highly interpretable, \\ntransparent, and efficient at summarizing concepts, these methods often neglect context, leading to \\npotential misinterpretations 25. LIWC may classify the word mad as an indicator of anger, yet in \\nphrases like\\n######################\\nOutput:\\n\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Adolescents\\\"<|>\\\"person\\\"<|>\\\"Adolescents are individuals aged 14-18 whose emotional fluctuations are tracked for understanding mood dynamics and potential affective disorders.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Natural Language Processing\\\"<|>\\\"technology\\\"<|>\\\"Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a multidisciplinary field that combines computer science, artificial intelligence, and linguistics to analyze text data and track emotions efficiently.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Emotion Prediction Study\\\"<|>\\\"event\\\"<|>\\\"The Emotion Prediction Study explores forecasting adolescents' daily negative affect through various modeling approaches using text features.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Ecological Momentary Assessment\\\"<|>\\\"method\\\"<|>\\\"Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) is a method used to collect real-time data from adolescents regarding their emotional states.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Random Forest and Elastic Net Regression\\\"<|>\\\"technology\\\"<|>\\\"Random Forest and Elastic Net Regression are predictive modeling techniques evaluated in the study for emotion prediction based on text features.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"LIWC\\\"<|>\\\"technology\\\"<|>\\\"Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) is a closed-vocabulary program used for text analysis that categorizes words based on predefined dictionaries.\\\")##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Adolescents\\\"<|>\\\"Emotion Prediction Study\\\"<|>\\\"The Emotion Prediction Study is focused on understanding the emotional fluctuations of adolescents and predicting their negative affect.\\\"<|>\\\"emotion tracking, research focus\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Natural Language Processing\\\"<|>\\\"Emotion Prediction Study\\\"<|>\\\"Natural Language Processing techniques are employed in the Emotion Prediction Study to analyze text data for predicting emotions.\\\"<|>\\\"data analysis, emotion prediction\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Ecological Momentary Assessment\\\"<|>\\\"Adolescents\\\"<|>\\\"Ecological Momentary Assessment is used to gather real-time emotional data from adolescents in the study.\\\"<|>\\\"data collection, real-time assessment\\\"<|>7)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Random Forest and Elastic Net Regression\\\"<|>\\\"Emotion Prediction Study\\\"<|>\\\"Random Forest and Elastic Net Regression models are assessed in the Emotion Prediction Study for their effectiveness in emotion prediction.\\\"<|>\\\"model evaluation, predictive techniques\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"LIWC\\\"<|>\\\"Natural Language Processing\\\"<|>\\\"LIWC is a method within Natural Language Processing that provides a way to analyze text for emotional indicators based on word frequencies.\\\"<|>\\\"text analysis, emotion categorization\\\"<|>6)##\\n(\\\"content_keywords\\\"<|>\\\"emotion tracking, adolescents, Natural Language Processing, predictive modeling\\\")<|COMPLETE|>\"}]\nMANY entities were missed in the last extraction.

We encourage readers to explore the web app to engage more \\ndeeply with the data and insights. \\nDemographic and clinical characteristics \\nTable 2 presents the demographic and clinical characteristics of the participants. For the \\nparticipants who completed EMA in four consecutive weeks, the median number of EMA surveys \\ncompleted was 77 (M = 75, SD = 24), and mean EMA compliance was 67% (SD = 21%).  For the \\nparticipants who completed EMA in biweekly 5-day blocks, the median number of EMA surveys \\ncompleted was 66 (M = 68, SD = 24), and mean EMA compliance was 51% (SD = 17%).  \\nModel performance: Nomothetic Approach \\nTable 3 presents model performance metrics for predicting negative affect using combined text \\nfeatures from three NLP techniques. Three modeling approaches are compared: group-level \\nnomothetic (one model combining all observations), per-participant nomothetic (performance \\ncalculated separately), and idiographic (separate models for each individual). Further details and \\nresults, including separate models for each NLP technique, are available in the Web app (see \\\"Model \\nperformance across sample” and “Model performance per participant”). \\nThe group-level nomothetic model performed well, with R² values ranging from 0.11 to 0.38. \\nHowever, when evaluated separately for each participant, which is critical given the ultimate goal of \\ntracking fluctuations in emotions within individuals, performance decreased substantially. Mean R² \\nvalues fell between 0.06 and 0.11, with considerable variability in predictive accuracy across \\n 8participants. For example, when predicting mean negative affect, individual R² values ranged from \\n0.00 to 0.41, demonstrating that while text features explained little to no variability in negative affect \\nfor some, they accounted for a significant proportion of variability in others. See Table 3 for results for \\nthe specific emotions of sadness, anger, and nervousness. \\nModel performance: Idiographic Approach \\nThe idiographic approach (separate models for each individual) showed similar average \\nperformance to the nomothetic approach, with mean R² values ranging from 0.06 to 0.10. However, the \\nidiographic approach demonstrated better performance in terms of RMSE (0.47 to 0.76) compared to \\nthe nomothetic model (0.52 to 0.88), suggesting lower prediction error. In addition, for negative affect, \\nthe idiographic approach showed greater variability in R² across participants, achieving higher \\naccuracy for some individuals. However, the nomothetic approach identified significant associations in \\na larger proportion of participants (55–58% vs. 43–48%). A similar pattern emerged for sadness, \\nsuggesting that while person-specific models can improve accuracy for certain individuals, the \\nnomothetic approach is more robust for detecting significant associations across a broader sample. Fig. \\n2 displays the relationship between predicted and observed (actual) negative affect ratings using \\nperson-specific (idiographic) models. Each colored line represents an individual participant’s predicted \\nestimates (y axis) across different levels of actual negative affect (x axis). While the overall trend, \\nrepresented by the dashed black line, suggests a generally positive relationship between predicted and \\nactual ratings, indicating that the models capture meaningful within-person fluctuations in negative \\naffect, this should not be taken to imply consistent accuracy at the individual level. The notable \\nbetween-person differences in model fit underscore that good overall performance does not guarantee \\nreliable prediction for every participant. \\nFig. 3 displays the substantial differences in model accuracy across individuals by showcasing \\nexamples of four high- vs low-accuracy person-specific models (figures for all other outcomes and for \\n 9all participants for both the nomothetic and idiographic models are available on the Web app “True vs. \\nPredicted”). \\nExamining Between-Person Differences in Which Text Features Predict Negative Affect \\nFig. 4 illustrates the variability in feature importance by showing the top 10 text features from \\nthe four best-performing subject-specific random forest models predicting negative affect. These \\nmodels are the same four high-accuracy models displayed in Fig. 3. The results show two types of \\nvariability between individuals: differences in model performance and, even among highly accurate \\nmodels, differences in the text features that contribute to predicting negative affect. Critically, this \\nvisualization demonstrates how text features provide valuable contextual information. For example, \\none participant (K23541) exhibits more negative emotions when using words related to their family \\n(\\\"Family\\\"), yet another (KTGF533) shows greater negative emotions when focusing on the past \\n(\\\"FocusPast\\\"). Similarly, a different participant (KTGF528) expresses more negative emotions when \\nwriting about work-related topics (\\\"Work\\\") but demonstrates less negativity when using words \\nassociated with acquiring objects, states, or goals that fulfill personal needs (\\\"Acquire\\\"). This rich \\ninformation can be used to create person-specific profiles that enable us to identify the specific \\ncontexts in which negative emotions arise, providing insights that can be used to personalize \\ninterventions. A heatmap of the feature importance across participants and feature importance figures \\nfor each participant, outcome, and ML model are available on the Web app (\\\"Feature importance \\nheatmap\\\" and \\\"Feature importance per participant\\\").

GPT is built on a transformer-based architecture, a neural network design that excels at \\n 20processing sequential data by using self-attention mechanisms to capture contextual relationships \\nacross words. This allows GPT to generate human-like text by predicting the next word in a sequence \\nbased on the provided context. Specifically, we used GPT-4, an advanced version pre-trained on a vast \\ndataset (45TB), enabling it to generate coherent sentences and perform various tasks such as writing, \\nanswering questions, and engaging in conversations. In this study, we prompted GPT-4 through the \\napplication programming interface (API) using Python code to rate the extent to which a participant \\nexperienced one of the following emotions: Sadness, Anger, and Nervousness, on a scale of 1 to 5 \\n(similar to the scale used in EMA), based on responses to three open-text questions. See the \\nsupplement for the full prompt used to generate GPT responses. \\nData Analysis \\nModel Specification   \\nWe began our analysis by extracting text data from EMA responses and conducting both lexicon-\\nbased and transformer-based analyses. Next, we applied preprocessing steps (e.g., text normalization, \\nstopword removal, stemming) to refine the text before performing topic modeling. Finally, we trained \\nmachine learning models to predict negative affect based on the derived text features, evaluated model \\nperformance, and determined feature importance. Fig. 1 illustrates this analysis pipeline in detail. \\nWe compared both nomothetic (group-level) and idiographic (individual-level) models in their \\nability to predict variability in negative emotional states within individuals over time. We employed \\ntwo machine learning approaches to predict negative affect: elastic net regression and random forest \\nmodels. Elastic net regularization (ENR) is a popular variant of conventional regression that combines \\ntwo types of penalties: ridge and lasso. This combination helps address issues related to \\nmulticollinearity by constraining the coefficients of correlated variables while also minimizing model \\noverfitting. On the other hand, random forest (RF) is an ensemble learning method based on decision \\ntrees. Unlike ENR, random forest can capture complex nonlinear relationships and interactions \\nbetween variables without having to specify them in advance. Given that these two methods rely on \\n 21different algorithms (i.e., penalized regression- vs decision tree-based approaches) for selecting \\nvariables, assessing their importance, and generating predictions, comparing them can help to \\ndetermine which one provides the most accurate predictions in a given context. \\nTo assess model performance and generalizability while minimizing overfitting, we implemented \\na nested cross-validation (CV) procedure using the nestedcv package in R (Lewis et al., 2023). A full \\ndescription of the nested CV procedure is provided in section S3 in the Supplement. We evaluated \\nmodel accuracy using R² (the square of the correlation coefficient) and root mean squared error \\n(RMSE). R² was our primary metric because we wanted to prioritize the model's ability to detect \\nincreases in negative emotional states, reflected in corresponding increases in predicted scores. While a \\nstronger correlation (and thus higher R²) indicates better alignment between predicted and observed \\nvalues, it doesn't necessarily imply lower average prediction error, which is captured by the RMSE. \\nInitially, we ran nomothetic models using features extracted from all three NLP approaches, \\nincluding all subjects for group-level analysis. These models identified common predictors of negative \\nemotional states at the group level. To evaluate how well these group-level models generalized to \\nindividual participants, we calculated individual metrics, such as R², derived from the nomothetic \\nmodels for each participant. Subsequently, we employed fully idiographic models, building separate \\nmodels for each participant to capture person-specific language-emotion associations. These models \\nfocused exclusively on within-person variability, aiming for highly individualized predictions. In these \\nidiographic models, variables with low variance were removed based on standard frequency criteria, \\nwhere the most common value for that variable could not exceed 95% of the total observations. \\nFinally, we compared the three abovementioned approaches, to understand their relative strengths in \\npredicting negative affect. \\nFeature importance   \\nTo evaluate feature importance, we used SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values, which \\nquantify the contribution of each feature to the model's predictions in a consistent and interpretable \\n 22manner by assessing how variations in a feature impact the model's output 50. SHAP values were \\ncalculated using the R packages fastshap and ggbeeswarm , which facilitates visualization and \\ninterpretation of feature contributions. This method allowed us to identify the relative importance of \\npredictors in the model and their specific effects on the predicted outcomes.  \\n \\nReferences \\n1. Barrett, L.

Unlike predefined \\ndictionaries, LDA infers topics directly from the data, allowing it to capture latent semantic \\nstructures. Each word is assigned probabilistically to one or more topics, iterating until an \\noptimal balance between word distributions is reached. This process generates posterior \\nprobability distributions that estimate the likelihood of words appearing in specific topics, \\nenabling LDA to account for contextual meanings and reduce word sense ambiguity. \\nTo improve topic coherence and capture meaningful linguistic patterns, we applied LDA \\nto one- to three-word phrases rather than individual words, ensuring that multi-word expressions \\n(e.g., \\\"summer camp\\\" ) were treated as single units. We implemented LDA separately for \\nnomothetic and idiographic analyses. The nomothetic model extracted a uniform set of topics \\nacross all participants, while the idiographic model identified personalized topics for each \\nindividual. \\nFor topic extraction, we used the R package topicmodels  (Grün & Hornik, 2011) and \\nperformed algorithmic tuning to determine the optimal number of topics ( k) using ldatuning . The \\ntuning process involved evaluating multiple model fit metrics, including Griffiths2004 (Griffiths \\net al., 2004), CaoJuan2009 (Cao et al., 2009), and Arun2010 (Arun et al., 2010). These metrics \\nprovide different optimization criteria: Griffiths2004 favors maximizing coherence, whereas \\nCaoJuan2009 and Arun2010 minimize redundancy and overfitting. Additionally, we considered \\nthe Deveaud2014 reference point, which decreases linearly with the number of topics. Based on \\nthese criteria, we selected six topics as an optimal balance, as illustrated in Fig. 1S. \\n 38Section 2: Prompt GPT \\n\\\"\\\"\\\" Evaluate the extent to which the participant experienced each of the following emotions: sadness, anger, \\nnervousness, happiness, excitement, interest, boredom, general ratings of positive affect (pa), and general \\nratings of negative affect (na) based on their responses to three questions. \\n \\nWhen evaluating emotions, consider the context of each question.

The slider is linked to a callback that forces the two \nhandles to be opposites (e.g., if one is set to –0.005, the other becomes 0.005). \no Info Box: A message box below the slider explains which SHAP importance values \nwill be included (those outside the threshold) and which will be filtered out. \nGraph Details: \n Graph Type: Heatmap \n Axes: \no X-Axis: Represents the selected participants. When “All” is chosen, the x-axis shows a \nsingle label (“All Participants”); otherwise, it shows individual participant names.  \no Y-Axis: Represents the features (variables) that passed the importance threshold. \n Data Processing: \no Data is loaded from a CSV (named by model and outcome). After grouping and \naveraging, the data is pivoted so that features form the rows and participants the \ncolumns. \no The pivoted data is filtered based on the importance threshold. \n Colors: \no Color Scale: A custom color scale is used: \n Deep Blue represents strong negative SHAP values. \n White represents neutral importance. \n Deep Red represents strong positive SHAP values. \no Feature Label Colors: Each feature label on the y-axis is colored according to its NLP \nmethod (using a predefined color map such as LIWC in red, GPT in blue, etc.). \n Layout Adjustments: \no The heatmap’s height and width are dynamically set based on the number of features \nand participants. \no A legend below the graph (built using HTML) explains the color mapping for the NLP \nmethods. \n \nPage 6: Feature Importance per Participant (SHAP Value) \n \n UI & Data Controls: \n Layout: Similar to Page 5, this page uses a two-column layout with controls in the right \ncolumn and the visualization in the left column. \n Controls: \no Outcome & Model Dropdowns: Allow the user to select the outcome and ML model \n(with outcome normalized). \no Participant Dropdown: Enables the selection of a single participant from the loaded \ndataset. \no Performance Metrics Loading: A secondary CSV is loaded to extract performance \nmetrics (R² and RMSE) for the selected participant, which are later shown in the graph \ntitle. \no Dynamic Symmetric Slider: As on Page 5, a slider is provided for setting the threshold \nfor feature importance. It uses a symmetric range and displays an info box. \nGraph Details: \n Graph Type: SHAP Summary Scatter Plot with Vertical Lines \n Axes: \no X-Axis: Represents the SHAP (feature importance) values. \no Y-Axis: Represents features. The y-axis values are evenly spaced for each feature, and \nfeature names are used as tick labels. \n Data Processing: \no Data is filtered for the selected participant and then filtered based on the chosen \nimportance threshold. \no The data is sorted by NLP method (and importance) and assigned evenly spaced y-axis \npositions. \n Colors: \no Vertical Lines & Markers: Each feature’s importance is shown with a line extending \nfrom 0 to the SHAP value, with a dot at the end. The color of the line and dot \ncorresponds to the feature’s NLP method (e.g., LIWC is red, GPT is blue, etc.). \no Legend: Additional dummy traces ensure every NLP method appears in the legend. \n Additional Features: \no The\n######################\nOutput:\n"

The slider is linked to a callback that forces the two \\nhandles to be opposites (e.g., if one is set to –0.005, the other becomes 0.005). \\no Info Box: A message box below the slider explains which SHAP importance values \\nwill be included (those outside the threshold) and which will be filtered out. \\nGraph Details: \\n Graph Type: Heatmap \\n Axes: \\no X-Axis: Represents the selected participants. When “All” is chosen, the x-axis shows a \\nsingle label (“All Participants”); otherwise, it shows individual participant names.  \\no Y-Axis: Represents the features (variables) that passed the importance threshold. \\n Data Processing: \\no Data is loaded from a CSV (named by model and outcome). After grouping and \\naveraging, the data is pivoted so that features form the rows and participants the \\ncolumns. \\no The pivoted data is filtered based on the importance threshold. \\n Colors: \\no Color Scale: A custom color scale is used: \\n Deep Blue represents strong negative SHAP values. \\n White represents neutral importance. \\n Deep Red represents strong positive SHAP values. \\no Feature Label Colors: Each feature label on the y-axis is colored according to its NLP \\nmethod (using a predefined color map such as LIWC in red, GPT in blue, etc.). \\n Layout Adjustments: \\no The heatmap’s height and width are dynamically set based on the number of features \\nand participants. \\no A legend below the graph (built using HTML) explains the color mapping for the NLP \\nmethods. \\n \\nPage 6: Feature Importance per Participant (SHAP Value) \\n \\n UI & Data Controls: \\n Layout: Similar to Page 5, this page uses a two-column layout with controls in the right \\ncolumn and the visualization in the left column. \\n Controls: \\no Outcome & Model Dropdowns: Allow the user to select the outcome and ML model \\n(with outcome normalized). \\no Participant Dropdown: Enables the selection of a single participant from the loaded \\ndataset. \\no Performance Metrics Loading: A secondary CSV is loaded to extract performance \\nmetrics (R² and RMSE) for the selected participant, which are later shown in the graph \\ntitle. \\no Dynamic Symmetric Slider: As on Page 5, a slider is provided for setting the threshold \\nfor feature importance. It uses a symmetric range and displays an info box. \\nGraph Details: \\n Graph Type: SHAP Summary Scatter Plot with Vertical Lines \\n Axes: \\no X-Axis: Represents the SHAP (feature importance) values. \\no Y-Axis: Represents features. The y-axis values are evenly spaced for each feature, and \\nfeature names are used as tick labels. \\n Data Processing: \\no Data is filtered for the selected participant and then filtered based on the chosen \\nimportance threshold. \\no The data is sorted by NLP method (and importance) and assigned evenly spaced y-axis \\npositions. \\n Colors: \\no Vertical Lines & Markers: Each feature’s importance is shown with a line extending \\nfrom 0 to the SHAP value, with a dot at the end. The color of the line and dot \\ncorresponds to the feature’s NLP method (e.g., LIWC is red, GPT is blue, etc.). \\no Legend: Additional dummy traces ensure every NLP method appears in the legend. \\n Additional Features: \\no The\\n######################\\nOutput:\\n\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Negative Affect\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Negative Affect is an emotional category representing feelings such as anger, nervousness, and sadness that can be quantified during data analysis.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Participant\\\"<|>\\\"person\\\"<|>\\\"Participants are individuals whose data is being analyzed in relation to various NLP approaches and outcomes, central to the study's findings.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"ML Model\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"ML Models represent different machine learning techniques used in the analysis, specifically Elastic Net and Random Forest as highlighted in the document.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"CSV Files\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"CSV Files are data files used to aggregate and filter data from multiple sources for analysis in the study, focusing on NLP approaches.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Heatmap\\\"<|>\\\"event\\\"<|>\\\"Heatmap is a graphical representation used to visualize the importance of features within the dataset based on SHAP values.\\\")##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Participant\\\"<|>\\\"Negative Affect\\\"<|>\\\"Participants are evaluated based on their emotional responses, with Negative Affect being one of the key outcomes measured.\\\"<|>\\\"evaluation, emotional response\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"CSV Files\\\"<|>\\\"ML Model\\\"<|>\\\"CSV Files contain data processed using different ML Models for analysis, showing a direct connection in facilitating the research study.\\\"<|>\\\"data processing, analysis connection\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Heatmap\\\"<|>\\\"Participant\\\"<|>\\\"The Heatmap visualizes data related to each Participant based on feature importance, showcasing their individual contributions to the analysis.\\\"<|>\\\"data visualization, feature importance\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"content_keywords\\\"<|>\\\"data analysis, emotional categories, machine learning, visualization\\\")<|COMPLETE|>\"}]\nMANY entities were missed in the last extraction.

It provides insight into the emotional context of the content by assessing the emotional states conveyed through language. This can include the use of specific words that signify positive or negative emotions, which contribute to the overall sentiment of the text.\n\nIn the context of data analysis, understanding Emotional Tone is crucial because it helps in predicting and interpreting emotional states, particularly in studies focused on emotional fluctuations. By analyzing Emotional Tone, researchers can gain valuable insights into how individuals express their feelings and the emotional dynamics present in their communication.",
